    <title>Add Custom Transformation Scenarios</title>
    <body>
        <p>When distributing a framework to users, it is a good idea to have the transformation
            scenarios already configured. This helps the content authors publish their work in
            various formats. By being contained in the framework configuration, the scenarios can be
            distributed along with the actions, menus, toolbars, and catalogs: <xref
