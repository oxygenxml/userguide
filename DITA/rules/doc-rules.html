      <p class="p">The vast amount of rules that pertain to writing in the English language can be daunting,
        to say the least. There are also a lot of different opinions about which of those rules
        should be followed. There is a difference between the ability to speak in coherent and
        grammatically correct English and the ability to write effectively in English. Perhaps many
        of the common rules are not as important when it comes to verbal communication, but written
        documentation clearly needs to be consistent and follow a set of defined rules. It is also
        important to distinguish between concrete grammar rules that should always be followed and
        style rules that are simply guidelines or choices that will help make documentation to be
        more consistent and potent.</p>

      <p class="p">As a general rule for writing technical documentation, it is important to keep it as simple
        as possible while using enough creativity and solid writing skills to keep the reader
        engaged long enough to absorb whatever information they need to satisfy the reason they
        found the particular documentation in the first place. All talented writers have developed
        their skill over the course of time by writing <em class="ph i">A LOT</em>. However, following a set of
        rules and guidelines can help less experienced writers, as well as those without
        native-level language skills. Especially when documentation is written by multiple writers,
        it is important to have a common set of rules and guidelines to keep the documentation
        consistent, effective, and professional.</p>

                  <dd class="dd"><strong class="ph b">Description:</strong><dfn class="term">Conjunctive adverbs</dfn> are simply adverbs that
                    connect two independent clauses. They can sometimes move almost anywhere in a
                    sentence and they are usually used to link the ideas from two or more sentences,
                    but they can also be used to connect two independent main clauses in the same
                    sentence (although this is probably rare in technical documentation). Usually,
                    they are placed at the beginning of the second clause since it provides a
                    logical transition from one clause to the other. When used to connect two main
                    clauses a semicolon needs to be used between the first clause and the
                    conjunctive adverb, but again, this is rare in technical documentation. Most of
                    the time, the conjunctive adverbs need to be separated from the clause with one
                    or two commas.</dd>

                      words that start with a vowel. However, that is only partially correct.
                      REMEMBER, it is how the subsequent word SOUNDS, not how it is written. The
                      letters 'H' and 'U' usually cause the most confusion because some words that
                      start with those letters have a consonant sound and some have a vowel

                  <dd class="dd"><strong class="ph b">Description:</strong> An <dfn class="term">infinitive</dfn> is a two-word form of a verb,
                    such as <em class="ph i">"to read"</em> or <em class="ph i">"to understand"</em>. There is a common
                    misperception that you should not split infinitives, but there is actually
                    nothing wrong with doing so, although in technical writing it often means that
                    you are adding an unnecessary word. There are quite a few instances where using
                    split infinitives add meaning to a sentence. A common example is the phrase
                      <em class="ph i">"to better understand"</em>. Including the word <em class="ph i">"better"</em> certainly
                    adds some meaning. There are usually other ways to include these types of
                    powerful words without using them to split infinitives, but you also want to
                    avoid awkward sentences.</dd>

                      wrong with splitting infinitives, in technical writing, it is safer to avoid
                      them, if possible. However, you should also avoid creating awkward sentences
                      by trying too hard to avoid splitting infinitives. If you need to use an extra
                      word to add meaning and using that extra word to split an infinitive makes the
                      sentence less awkward than the alternatives, keep the split infinitive.</p>

                    sound quite monotonous, and it is often perceived as being unprofessional and

                    more items. In other words, it is the comma that comes before the final item in
                    the series. This is just a style rule and some writers choose to always include
                    the serial comma, while others choose to never include it. The important thing
                    is to always be consistent. However, omitting the serial comma can sometimes
                    leads to ambiguity, especially in complex sentences, so it seems more logical to
                    always include it rather than always omitting it.</dd>

                        <li class="li">Always hyphenate compound words that include hyphens in their dictionary
                          definitions. Examples: <em class="ph i">"right-click</em>, <em class="ph i">"double-click"</em>,

                        <li class="li">Do not hyphenate compounds that are formed with <em class="ph i">"ly"</em> adverbs,
                          even when they precede a noun they modify (for example, <em class="ph i">"fully

                          better to hyphenate them than the reverse.</li>

                      awkward. Based on that, in most cases, prefixes that result in two consecutive

                      technical writing is to make sure the information that you write is very
                      clear. Use the following rules to help avoid confusion:<ul class="ul">
                        <li class="li">Always proofread your writing carefully to identify possible

                          writing because it may seem clear to you, but if it is ambiguous to them,
                          in any way, then it is probably also ambiguous to your normal
                          audience.</li>

                        <li class="li">Be careful when using pronouns (<em class="ph i">"this</em>, <em class="ph i">"these"</em>,
                            <em class="ph i">"it"</em>). Always ask yourself if there is any chance that the reader
                          will not know exactly what items the pronouns are referencing. See the

                  <dd class="dd"><u class="ph u"><strong class="ph b">Rules or Suggestions:</strong></u> Particularly in technical writing, you
                    should avoid using a <dfn class="term">passive voice</dfn> whenever possible.
                      <dfn class="term">Passive</dfn> writing comes across as sounding weak and ambiguous,
                    while using in an active voice makes your writing seem more alive and clear.
                    Basically, passive voice happens when the object of a sentence is placed in the
                    beginning of a sentence instead of the end. In other words, the object becomes
                    the subject. For example, <em class="ph i">"I mailed the letter"</em> becomes passive if it is
                    changed to <em class="ph i">"The letter was mailed by me"</em>.<dl class="dl">

                        <dd class="dd">The two most basic things to ask yourself are:<ul class="ul">
                            <li class="li">Is the object in the subject position?</li>

                            <li class="li">Can I add <em class="ph i">"by [so-and-so]"</em> to the end?</li>

                          </ul>
</dd>

                        <dd class="dd">Also, keep this in mind: All passive sentences include a form of the
                          verb <em class="ph i">"to be"</em> (such as <em class="ph i">"was"</em>, <em class="ph i">"were"</em> or <em class="ph i">"is"</em>),
                          BUT not all sentences that have those verbs are passive. It is easy to
                          recognize sentences that include a form of <em class="ph i">"to be"</em> but you need to
                          ask yourself the two questions above to determine if it is in the passive
                          voice.</dd>

                    because they are stuck and need to figure out how to do something specific.

                    differently than they do other types of writing. They tend to skim through
                    documentation to quickly find the information they need. This means good
                    technical documentation needs to have a lot of structured markup to emphasize
                    content and point the reader directly to information they need for the specific

                    the specific part of the topic that contains the information they are looking
                    for, without needing to read other content that may not be relevant to their
                    specific need. Each section should contain a good title that describes the

                      Likewise, paragraphs should also as short as possible because our brains take
