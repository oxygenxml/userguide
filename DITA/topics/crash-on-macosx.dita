        could not start up on my Mac OS X computer due to a JVM crash. What can I do?</p>

      <p>Usually it is an incompatibility between the Apple JVM and a native library of the host
        system. More details are available in the crash log file generated by OS X and reported in
        the crash error message.</p>
