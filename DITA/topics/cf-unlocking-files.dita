  <title>Unlocking Files</title>
  <body>
    <p id="p_bst_dgk_54b">While you are editing a file, the file remains locked and others cannot
      edit it. If other people have the file opened, you will see their avatars on the right side of
      the <uicontrol>Files</uicontrol> box. You can hover over an avatar to see the name of the
      person. If someone else is currently editing the particular file, you will see a
          <uicontrol><image href="../img/CF_Lock20.png" id="image_n3b_kqt_pjb"/>Lock</uicontrol>
      icon on the left side of the <uicontrol>Files</uicontrol> box and that person's avatar on the
      right side of the <uicontrol>Files</uicontrol> box will have a red border. When a file is
      locked, no one else can edit the file until that person navigates back to the <xref
        href="cf-task-files.dita"><uicontrol>Task Files</uicontrol> page</xref>, closes the browser,
      or uses the <uicontrol>Finalize Review</uicontrol> button.</p>
    <p id="p_cst_dgk_54b">If you remain inactive for more than 10 minutes, the editor switches to
      read-only mode and the file is unlocked, which means other users have access to edit it. If
      other users do not start editing the file, or once they are finished and it becomes unlocked,
      a <uicontrol>Resume Editing</uicontrol> button will be displayed that can be used to switch
      back to editing mode. Note that the lock status is automatically refreshed every minute, so if
      another user unlocks a file, you may not see the status change for a minute unless you refresh
      the page manually.</p>
