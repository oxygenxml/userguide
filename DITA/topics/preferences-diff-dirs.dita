        <p product="editor author diff developer">For the directories comparison, you can specify:</p>
        <ul id="directories-comparison-options" product="editor author diff developer">
            <li><uicontrol>Compare files by</uicontrol> - Controls the method used for comparing two files:<ul>
                    <li><uicontrol>Content</uicontrol> - The file content is compared using the
                        current <xref
                            href="preferences-diff-files.dita#preferences-diff-files/diff-algorithm"
                            format="dita">diff algorithm</xref>. This option is applied for a pair
                        of files only if that file type is associated with a built-in editor type
                        (either associated by default or associated by the user when the user is
                        prompted to do that on opening a file of that type for the first time).</li>
                    <li><uicontrol>Binary Compare</uicontrol> - The files are compared at byte
                        level.</li>
                    <li><uicontrol>Timestamp (last modified date / time)</uicontrol> - The files are
                        compared only by their last modified timestamp.</li>
                </ul></li>
            <li><uicontrol>Look in archives</uicontrol> - If checked, <xref
                    href="preferences-archive.dita">archives known by <ph
                            keyref="product"/> 
                </xref> are considered directories and their content is compared just like regular
                files.</li>
            <li id="preference_navigation"><uicontrol>Navigation</uicontrol> - This options control
                the behaviour of the differences traversal actions (<uicontrol>Go to previous
                    modification</uicontrol>, <uicontrol>Go to next modification</uicontrol>) when
                the first or last difference in a file is reached:<ul>
                    <li><uicontrol>Ask what to do next</uicontrol> - A dialog is displayed asking
                        you to confirm that you want the application to display modifications from
                        the previous or next file.</li>
                    <li><uicontrol>Go to the next/previous file</uicontrol> - The application opens
                        the next or previous file without waiting for your confirmation.</li>
                    <li><uicontrol>Do nothing</uicontrol> - No further action is taken.</li>
                </ul></li>
