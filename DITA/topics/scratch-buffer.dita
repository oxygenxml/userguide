    <p>A handy addition to the document editing is the <uicontrol>Scratch Buffer</uicontrol> view
      used for storing fragments of arbitrary text during the editing process. It can be used to
      drop bits of paragraphs (including arbitrary XML markup fragments) while rearranging and
      editing the document and also to drag and drop fragments of text from the scratch buffer to
      the editor panel. The <uicontrol>Scratch Buffer</uicontrol> is basically a text area offering
      XML syntax highlight. The view contextual menu contains basic edit actions like
        <uicontrol>Cut</uicontrol>, <uicontrol>Copy</uicontrol>, and
      <uicontrol>Paste</uicontrol>.</p>
