    <p id="p_fzt_dgk_54b">A <i>task owner</i> can close the review process to reserve some time to
      address the feedback before integrating the changes. To close a task, click the
        <uicontrol>Close review</uicontrol> button located in the top stripe (with a task opened).
      This locks the task and prevents others from making changes to it. If further review is
      needed, you can click the <uicontrol>Reopen review</uicontrol> button to make the task
      editable again.</p>
    <p id="p_xsg_f1j_21c">For tasks created outside a Content Fusion project, once a <i>task
        owner</i> has integrated the changes into the source documentation project, they can click
      the <uicontrol>Mark as integrated</uicontrol> button in the top stripe to archive the task,
      remove it from visibility for all users, and make it uneditable. A <i>task owner</i> can view
      integrated (archived) tasks by clicking the <uicontrol>Show integrated review
        tasks</uicontrol> button at the bottom of the <uicontrol>Owned By Me</uicontrol> tab in the
        <uicontrol>My Review Task</uicontrol> page.</p>
