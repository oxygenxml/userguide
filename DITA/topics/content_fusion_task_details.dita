          Tasks</uicontrol> in the top stripe, or you can click the <uicontrol><image

        resets the finalized status for all reviewers and their status is changed to <i>In
          progress</i>. Also, if the task owner re-opens a <xref href="cf-closing-tasks.dita">closed
          task</xref>, the finalized status is reset for all reviewers.</p>
      <p id="p_p2b_1lb_z1c">Any users who have been assigned to the task but have not yet accessed
        it are labeled as <i>Pending</i> in the <uicontrol>Review Status Summary</uicontrol> pop-up
        window so that task owners can identify users who have ignored the review request.</p>
      <p id="p_yrn_zk2_h1c">When a reviewer opens a task that the owner requested that they do
        another review, the <uicontrol>Task Files</uicontrol> page includes a <uicontrol>Changed

        that need to be reviewed again.</p>
