          <li id="li_nl5_dgk_54b">System requirements: On the server running Content Fusion, you need enough disk space
            to create a backup. The backup file contains a compressed archive of all files located
            in <filepath>/fusion/data/</filepath>, so to be safe, the free space should be at least
            equal to the size of the data folder.</li>
          <li id="li_pl5_dgk_54b">Custom frameworks and plugins will need to be reinstalled manually on the new
            server.</li>
          <li id="li_ql5_dgk_54b">The upgrade process will involve some downtime, so pick a time that does not affect
            the users.</li>
