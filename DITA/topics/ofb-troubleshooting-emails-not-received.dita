        <p id="p_jdz_wgn_2pb">To address issues with not receiving emails from the Feedback system,
          try the following possible solutions:<ul id="ul_kxz_xgn_2pb">
            <li id="li_lxz_xgn_2pb"><b>Check Your Emails Settings</b> - Ensure that your email
              settings are correctly configured to receive notifications from the Feedback
              system.</li>
            <li id="li_qgg_mdq_ncc"><b>Verify Your Role</b> - Make sure you have the appropriate
              role (e.g. Owner, Admin) that allows you to receive email notifications. You can check
              your role in the <xref href="ofb-team-management.dita">Management Team
              page</xref>.</li>
            <li id="li_rgg_mdq_ncc"><b>Check Spam/Junk Folder</b> - It is possible for Feedback
              emails to end up in your spam or junk folder. Make sure to check these folders and
              mark these emails as not spam.</li>
            <li id="li_qql_pdq_ncc"><b>Remove Email Filters</b> - Ensure that there are no email
              filters set up that might be redirecting the feedback emails to another folder.</li>
            <li id="li_g3c_sdq_ncc"><b>Contact Support</b> - If you have tried all of the above and
              are still not receiving emails, you can contact the support team for further
              assistance by using the <xref href="ofb-technical-support-page.dita">Technical Support
                page</xref>.</li>
