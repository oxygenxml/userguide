    <p>In DITA, the content of almost any element can be made reusable simply by adding an
        <codeph>id</codeph> attribute to the element. The DITA content reference mechanism can reuse
      any element with an <i>ID</i>. However, it is not considered best practice to
      arbitrarily reuse pieces of text from random topics due to the difficulties this creates in
      trying to manage it. It also creates the possibility of authors deleting or changing content
      that is reused in other topics without being aware that the content is reused.</p>
    <p>To prevent these types of problems, you can create reusable components to manage a separate
      set of topics that contain topics designed specifically for reuse. Then, all of your reusable
      content can be referenced from the reusable components and if the content needs to be updated
      you only need to edit it in one place.</p>
    <p><ph keyref="product"/> allows you to select content in a topic, create a reusable component
      from it and reference that component in other locations by using the <uicontrol>Create
        Reusable Component</uicontrol> and <uicontrol>Insert Reusable Component</uicontrol>
      actions.</p>
