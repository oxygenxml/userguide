    <p>For editing large documents (file size up to 300 Megabytes), a special memory optimization is
      implemented on loading such a file so that the total memory allocated for the application is
      not exceeded. </p>
    <p>A temporary buffer file is created on disk so you have to make sure that the available free
      disk space is at least double the size of the large file that you want to edit. For example,
        <ph keyref="product"/> can load a 200-Megabytes file using a minimum memory setting of 512
      Megabytes and at least 400-Megabytes free disk space.</p>
    <p>The increase of the maximum size of editable files comes with the following restrictions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A file larger than the value of the above option is edited only in Text mode.</li>
      <li>The <xref href="automatic-validation.dita">automatic validation</xref> is not available
        when editing a very large file.</li>
      <li>The XPath filter is disabled in <xref href="find-replace-dialog.dita">the Find/Replace
          dialog</xref>.</li>
      <li>The bidirectional Unicode support (right-to-left writing) is disabled.</li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <xref href="preferences-editor-format.dita">The option <uicontrol>Format and indent the
              document on open</uicontrol>
          </xref> is disabled for non-XML documents. For XML documents, it is done optimizing the
          memory usage but without respecting the options set in <xref
            href="preferences-editor-format.dita">the <uicontrol>Format</uicontrol> preferences
            page</xref>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>Less precise localizations for the results of an <xref href="xpath-console.dita">XPath
          expression</xref>.</li>
    </ul>
