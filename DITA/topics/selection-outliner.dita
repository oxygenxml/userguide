    <p>The Outline view can also be used to search for a specific tag's location and contents in the
      edited document. Intuitively, by selecting with the left mouse button the desired tag in the
      Outline view, the document is scrolled to the position of the selected tag. Moreover, the
      tag's contents are selected in the document, making it easy to notice the part of the document
      contained by that specific tag and furthermore to easily copy and paste the tag's contents in
      other parts of the document or in other documents. </p>
    <p product="editor author developer">You can double click the tag in the Outliner tree to move focus to
      the editor.</p>
    <p>You can also use key search to look for a particular tag name in the Outline tree.</p>
