    <p>If you need to validate the edited document with a validation engine that is different from
      the built-in engine, you can configure external validators in the <xref
        href="preferences-editor-custom-validation.dita#preferences-editor-custom-validation">Custom
        Validation Engines preferences page</xref>. After a custom validation engine is <xref
        href="preferences-editor-custom-validation.dita">properly configured</xref>, it can be
      applied on the current document by selecting it from the list of custom validation engines in
      the <uicontrol><image href="../img/ValidateDrop.png" id="image_bwv_p1w_sr"
        /> Validation</uicontrol> toolbar drop-down menu. The document is validated against the
      schema declared in the document. </p>
    <p>Some validators are configured by default but there are third-party processors that do not
      support the <xref
        href="linked-output-messages-of-external-engine.dita#linked-output-messages-of-external-engine"
        format="dita">output message format</xref> of <ph keyref="product"/> for linked
      messages:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>LIBXML</b> - Included in <ph keyref="product"/> (Windows edition only). It is
        associated to XML Editor. It is able to validate the edited document against XML Schema,
        Relax NG schema full syntax, internal DTD (included in the XML document) or a custom schema
        type. Support for <xref keyref="glossentry_xml-catalog"><term>XML Catalogs</term></xref>
        (the <parmname>--catalogs</parmname> parameter) and XInclude processing
          (<parmname>--xinclude</parmname>) are enabled by default in the preconfigured LIBXML
        validator. The <parmname>--postvalid</parmname> parameter is also set by default and it
        allows LIBXML to validate correctly the main document even if the XInclude fragments contain
        IDREFS to ID's located in other fragments.<p>For validation against an external DTD
          specified by URI in the XML document, add the <parmname>--dtdvalid ${ds}</parmname>
          parameter manually to the DTD validation command line. <codeph>${ds}</codeph> represents
          the detected DTD declaration in the XML document.</p><note type="caution">File paths
          containing spaces are not handled correctly in the LIBXML processor. For example, the
          built-in <xref keyref="glossentry_xml-catalog"><term>XML Catalog</term></xref> files of
          the predefined document types (DocBook, TEI, DITA, etc.) are not handled by LIBXML if <ph
            keyref="product"/> is installed in the default location on Windows (<filepath>C:\Program
            Files</filepath>) because the built-in <term>XML catalog</term> files are stored in the
            <filepath>frameworks</filepath> subfolder of the installation folder and in this case,
          the file path contains at least one space character.</note><note type="attention">On OS X, if the full path to the LIBXML executable file is not specified in
          the <uicontrol>Executable path</uicontrol> text field, some errors may occur during
          validation against a W3C XML Schema, such
            as:<codeblock outputclass="language-ini">Unimplemented block at ... xmlschema.c</codeblock><p>To
            avoid these errors, specify the full path to the LIBXML executable file.</p></note></li>
      <li><b>Saxon-EE</b> - Included in <ph keyref="product"/>. It is associated to XML Editor and
        XSD Editor. It is able to validate XML Schema schemas and XML documents against XML Schema
        schemas. The validation is done according to the W3C XML Schema 1.0 or 1.1. This can be
          <xref href="xml-schema-preferences-page.dita">configured in Preferences</xref>.</li>
      <li><b>MSXML 4.0</b> - Included in <ph keyref="product"/> (Windows edition only). It is
        associated to XML Editor, XSD Editor and XSL Editor. It is able to validate the edited
        document against XML Schema, internal DTD (included in the XML document), external DTD or a
        custom schema type.</li>
      <li><b>MSXML.NET</b> - Included in <ph keyref="product"/> (Windows edition only). It is

        custom schema type.</li>
      <li><b>XSV</b> - Not included in <ph keyref="product"/>. Windows and Linux distributions of

        this writing SQC2.2.1.zip is about 3 megabytes). The executable path and working directory
        are already configured for the SQC installation directory <filepath><term
            conkeyref="reusables-user-guide/oxy-install-dir"/>/sqc</filepath>. If it is installed in
