  <title>Why Integrate the Author Component with SharePoint</title>
  <body>
    <p>The Author Component can be embedded in a SharePoint site as a Java applet. This is a simple
      and convenient way for you to retrieve, open, and save XML and XML related documents stored on
      your company's SharePoint server, directly from your web browser. </p>
    <p>For example, let's say that you are working on a team project that uses the DITA framework
      for writing product documentation. You have the DITA Maps and topics stored on a SharePoint
      repository. By using a custom defined action from the contextual menu of a document, you can
      easily open it in the Author Component applet that is embedded in your SharePoint Documents
      page.</p>
      <p>You can embed the applet either on a site that is located on a standalone SharePoint
      server, or on your company's Microsoft Office 365 account.</p>
    <p>This example can be used as a starting point for other CMS integrations.</p>
