    <title>Changing File Permissions on a Remote FTP Server</title>
    <body>
        <p>Some FTP servers allow the modification of permissions of the files served over the FTP
            protocol. This protocol feature is accessible directly in the FTP<ph
                product="editor author developer svnClient diff">/WebDAV</ph> file browser dialog by
            right-clicking on a tree node and selecting the <i>Change permissions</i> menu item.</p>
        <p>The usual Unix file permissions <i>Read</i>, <i>Write</i> and <i>Execute</i> are granted
            or denied in this dialog for the file owner, owner group and the rest of the users. The
            permission's aggregate number is updated in the <i>Permissions</i> text field when it is
            modified with one of the check boxes.</p>
