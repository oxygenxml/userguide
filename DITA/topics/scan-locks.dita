  <title>Scanning for Locks</title>
  <body>
    <p id="p_syh_dgk_54b">When starting to work on a file that is not contextually mergeable (usually a binary file),
      it is better to verify if someone else is not already working on that file. You can do this in
      the <xref href="working-copy-view.dita"><uicontrol>Working Copy</uicontrol> view</xref> by
      selecting one or more resources, then right-clicking them and choosing the <uicontrol>Scan for
        Locks</uicontrol> action from the contextual menu.</p>

      <fig id="figure-svn-locked-items-dialog">
        <title>Locked Items Dialog Box</title>
        <image href="../img/sa_svn_locked_items_dialog.png"/>
      </fig>
    </p>
    <p id="p_uyh_dgk_54b">The <uicontrol>Locked items</uicontrol> dialog box contains a table with all the resources
      that were found locked on the repository. For each resource there are specified: resource
      path, state of the lock, owner of the lock, lock comment, creation and expiration date for the
      lock (if any).</p>
    <p id="p_vyh_dgk_54b">The state of the lock can be one of the following:</p>
    <ul id="ul_wyh_dgk_54b">
      <li id="li_xyh_dgk_54b"><image href="../img/SVNLockRemote10.png" id="image_nwz_251_tc"/> - Appears when one of the
        following conditions apply: <ul id="ul_yyh_dgk_54b">
          <li id="li_zyh_dgk_54b">Another user has locked the file in the repository.</li>
          <li id="li_azh_dgk_54b">The file was locked by the same user from another working copy.</li>
          <li id="li_bzh_dgk_54b">The file was locked from the <uicontrol>Repositories</uicontrol> view.</li>
        </ul></li>
      <li id="li_czh_dgk_54b"><image href="../img/SVNLockLocal10.png" id="image_lnj_vv1_tc"/> - Displayed after you have
        locked a file from the current working copy.</li>
      <li id="li_dzh_dgk_54b"><image href="../img/SVNLockBroken10.png"/> - A file already locked from your working copy
        is no longer locked in the repository (it was unlocked by another user).</li>
      <li id="li_ezh_dgk_54b"><image href="../img/SVNLockStolen10.png" id="image_j11_dw1_tc"/> - A file already locked
        from your working copy is being locked by another user. Now the owner of the file lock is
        the user who stole the lock from you.</li>
    </ul>
    <p id="p_fzh_dgk_54b">You can unlock a resource by selecting it and pressing the <uicontrol>Unlock</uicontrol>
      button.</p>
