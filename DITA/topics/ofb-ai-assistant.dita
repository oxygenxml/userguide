  <title>AI Assistant Chatbot</title>
  <body>
    <p id="p_jjd_b4b_qbc">It is possible to integrate a chatbot component in <b>Oxygen WebHelp
        Responsive</b> output where <b>Oxygen Feedback</b> is installed, allowing users to chat with
      the <uicontrol>AI Assistant</uicontrol> to help find answers to questions and find information
      more quickly and accurately.<note id="note_ed3_3sn_zyb"> This functionality requires the
        output to be generated using <b>Oxygen WebHelp</b> version 25 or later. </note></p>
    <p id="p_jh5_g4b_qbc">When the <xref href="#ofb-ai-assistant/section_cjj_wwp_dzb">functionality
        is enabled</xref>, a floating <uicontrol>AI Assistant</uicontrol> button is displayed in the
      lower-right corner of the WebHelp page. Clicking the button directs the user to the chat page
      associated with the current version for the site configuration.<note id="note_nkw_15b_qbc"
        type="note">To access the chat page, the user must be authenticated.</note></p>
    <p id="p_mmz_54b_qbc">In the chat page, the user can interact with the AI using the text field
      at the bottom of the page. It includes the following actions:<ul id="ul_db5_cpb_qbc">
        <li id="li_djm_npb_qbc"><uicontrol>Send</uicontrol> - Sends the data entered in the text
          field to the AI Assistant.</li>
        <li id="li_iqc_fpb_qbc"><uicontrol>Stop</uicontrol> - Stops a reply from the AI Assistant
          that is in progress after clicking the <uicontrol>Send</uicontrol> button.</li>
        <li id="li_eb5_cpb_qbc"><uicontrol>Clear chat</uicontrol> - Resets the discussion by
          removing the previous messages.</li>
        <li id="li_sp3_5pb_qbc"><uicontrol>Debug</uicontrol> [Available for users with an
          Organization or Site role of <i>Admin</i> or <i>Owner</i>] - Displays a log with the
          entire conversation with the AI Assistant.</li>
      </ul></p>
    <p id="p_htq_m5b_qbc">When you click the <uicontrol>Send</uicontrol> button, the message is
      submitted to the AI for processing and the progress is displayed above the message input area.
      The user can continue to type data in the message input area but the
        <uicontrol>Send</uicontrol> button is disabled until the reply from the AI is complete. Note
      that using the <uicontrol><shortcut>ENTER</shortcut></uicontrol> key adds a new line in the
      message and does not submit the message.</p>
    <p id="p_u4s_btd_4cc">After the search processes and the AI's response is received, the user can
      continue the discussion with the AI to refine the results by using the <uicontrol>Continue in
        chat</uicontrol> button that appears below the results in the right side. This sends the
      discussion to the chat page.</p>
    <p id="p_vbz_swd_4cc">
      <note id="note_zkd_twd_4cc">If the AI Assistant detects that the AI's previous response is not
        relevant in relation to the content of the user's current publication, the AI will send an
        additional reply with a statement explaining that the received response may not be fully
        relevant for the current publication.</note>
