  <title>Validating XSLT Stylesheets with Custom Engines</title>
  <body>
    <p>If you need to validate an XSLT stylesheet with a validation engine that is different from
      the built-in engine, you can configure external engines as custom XSLT validation engines in
      the <ph keyref="product"/> preferences. After a custom validation engine is <xref
        href="preferences-editor-custom-validation.dita">properly configured</xref>, it can be
      applied on the current document by selecting it from the list of custom validation engines in
      the <uicontrol><image href="../img/ValidateDrop.png" id="image_zsn_41w_sr"/>
        Validation</uicontrol> toolbar drop-down menu. The document is validated against the schema
      declared in the document. </p>
    <p>By default, there are two validators that are configured for XSLT stylesheets:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>MSXML 4.0</b> - included in <ph
          keyref="product"/> (Windows edition). It is
        associated to the XSL Editor type in <xref href="preferences-editor-custom-validation.dita"
          >Preferences page.</xref>
      </li>
      <li><b>MSXML.NET</b> - included in <ph
          keyref="product"/> (Windows edition). It is
        associated to the XSL Editor type in <xref href="preferences-editor-custom-validation.dita"
          >Preferences page.</xref></li>
    </ul>
