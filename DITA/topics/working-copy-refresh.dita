    <title>Refresh a Working Copy</title>
    <body>
        <p>A refresh is a frequent operation triggered automatically when you switch between two
      working copies using the toolbar selector of the <uicontrol>Working Copy</uicontrol> view and
      when you switch between <ph keyref="product"/> and other applications. </p>
        <p>The <uicontrol>Working Copy</uicontrol> view features a fast refresh mechanism: the
            content is cached locally when loading the working copy for the first time. Later on,
            when the same working copy is displayed again, the application uses this cache to detect
            the changes between the cached content and the current content found on disk. The
            refresh operation is run on these changes only, thus improving the response time.
            improvement is noticeable especially when working with large working copies.</p>
