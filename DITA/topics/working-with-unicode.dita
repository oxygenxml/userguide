    <p>Unicode provides a unique number for every character, independent of the platform and
      language. Unicode is internationally recognized and is required by modern standards (such as
      XML, Java, JavaScript, LDAP, CORBA 3.0, WML, etc.).</p>
    <p><ph keyref="product"/> provides support for the Unicode standard, enabling your XML
      application to be targeted across multiple platforms, languages, and countries without
      re-engineering. Internally, the <ph keyref="product"/> uses 16 bit characters covering the
      Unicode Character set.</p>
    <p product="editor author">As a Java application, <ph keyref="product"/> includes a default Java
      input method for typing characters with Unicode codes. However, the default input method does
      not cover all the Unicode codes (for example, the codes for some accented characters or
      characters found in East Asian languages). Such characters can be inserted in the editor panel
      of <ph keyref="product"/> either with <xref
        href="unicode-toolbar.dita#unicode-toolbar/fig_tfx_btv_5r">the <uicontrol>Character
          Map</uicontrol> dialog box</xref> available from <menucascade>
        <uicontrol>Edit</uicontrol>
        <uicontrol>Insert from Character Map</uicontrol>
      </menucascade> or by installing a Java input method that supports the insertion of the needed
      characters. The <xref
        href="http://java.sun.com/products/jfc/tsc/articles/InputMethod/inputmethod.html"
        scope="external" format="html">installation of a Java input method</xref> depends on the
      platform (Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, etc.) and is the same for any Java application.</p>
    <note><ph keyref="product"/> may not be able to
      display characters that are not supported by the operating system (either not installed or
      unavailable).</note>
    <note type="tip">On windows, you can enable the support for <b>CJK</b> (Chinese, Japanese,
      Korean) languages from <uicontrol>Control Panel / Regional and Language Options / Languages /
        Install files for East Asian languages</uicontrol>.</note>
