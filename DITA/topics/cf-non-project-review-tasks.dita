      <title>Non-Project Review Tasks vs Projects</title>
      <p id="p_fvr_c32_z1c">The main differences between working with non-project based review tasks
        and projects are:<ul id="ul_wcv_lxf_zxb">
          <li id="li_vc1_qxf_zxb"><b>Non-Project Review Tasks</b> - Provides tools for technical
            writers and reviewers to create and use review tasks for efficient collaboration during
            their documentation review process.</li>
          <li id="li_xcv_lxf_zxb"><b>Project Review Tasks</b> - Provides additional tools for
            technical writers to help manage a DITA project hosted in a Git repository while
            maintaining full compatibility with existing tools and workflows. Review tasks created
            within a Content Fusion project offer additional functionality, such as the ability to
            merge changes using a built-in file comparison/merge tool and to build WebHelp or PDF
            output deliverables.</li>
