    <p id="p_h4t_dgk_54b">The <ph keyref="product"/> browser interface can be accessed by using a
      task link and then logging in. Reviewers usually receive the link via some sort of messaging
      app, while task creators can access the interface by clicking on the task name in the
        <uicontrol>Tasks Manager</uicontrol> view (within <b>Oxygen XML Editor/Author</b>) or from
      your organization's Content Fusion browser login page.</p>
    <p id="p_zch_gqf_zxb">The <ph keyref="product"/> browser interface includes a top stripe that is
      always visible and it contains a user drop-down menu and other actions depending on the page
      that is opened within the interface. A left navigation stripe is also always visible and it
      contains buttons for navigating to various pages within the interface. The main area (below
      the top stripe and to the right of the left navigation stripe) displays the current page
      within the interface and is where most activities occur.</p>

            writers and reviewers to create and use review tasks for efficient collaboration during
            their documentation review process.</li>

            maintaining full compatibility with existing tools and workflows. Review tasks created
            within a Content Fusion project offer additional functionality, such as the ability to
            merge changes using a built-in file comparison/merge tool and to build WebHelp or PDF

        project, the buttons on the left stripe may change to reveal more navigation buttons,

        that are available when a page is open within a review task that you are assigned as an
        owner.</p>
