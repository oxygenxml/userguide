    <p>This chapter provides you with a variety of resources to
      <?oxy_comment_start author="ctalau-oxygen" timestamp="20160930T020117+0300" comment="Test"?>help<?oxy_comment_end?>
      you get the most out of the application. Typically, the first step of getting started with <ph
        keyref="product"/> would be to install the software. For detailed information about that
      process, see the <xref href="installation-intro.dita#installation-intro">Installation
        chapter</xref>.</p>
    <p>After installation, when you launch <ph keyref="product"/> for the first time, you are
      greeted with a <uicontrol>Welcome</uicontrol> dialog box. It presents upcoming events, useful
      video demonstrations, helpful resources, the tip of the day, and also gives you easy access to
      recently used files and projects and to create new ones.</p>

    <p>If you do not want it to be displayed every time you launch <ph keyref="product"/>, disable
      the <uicontrol>Show at startup</uicontrol> option. To display it any time, go to <menucascade>
        <uicontrol>Help</uicontrol>
        <uicontrol> Welcome</uicontrol>
      </menucascade>.</p>
