    <p>The <b>Content Author</b> refers to a user who creates documentation in <term>Oxygen XML
        Editor</term> or <term>Oxygen XML Author</term>. They will have access to the
        <uicontrol>Content Fusion Tasks Manager</uicontrol> view where they can create a task to
      upload files that need to be reviewed by others. The <b>Content Author</b> then simply shares
      a link to the task with one or more <b>Reviewers</b>.</p>
    <p>During the review process, the <b>Content Author</b> and all of the <b>Reviewers</b> can
      communicate directly in the <ph keyref="product"/> interface and once the process is finished,
      the <b>Content Author</b> has a convenient built-in <i>Merge</i> tool to integrate all the
      changes back into <term>Oxygen XML Editor</term> or <term>Oxygen XML Author</term>.</p>
    <p>This guide provides instructions and information about the features and options the
        <b>Content Author</b> has access to.</p>
