    <p id="p_mg3_dgk_54b">Sending the changes you made to your working copy is known as <i>committing</i> the changes.
      If your working copy is up-to-date and there are no conflicts, you are ready to commit your
      changes.</p>
    <p id="p_ng3_dgk_54b">The <uicontrol>Commit</uicontrol> action sends the changes from your local working copy to
      the repository. The <uicontrol>Commit</uicontrol> dialog box presents all the items that you
      can commit.</p>

      </fig>
    </p>
    <p id="p_qg3_dgk_54b">Enter a message to associate with the commit, or choose a previous message from the
        <uicontrol>Previous messages</uicontrol> list (the last 10 commit messages will be
      remembered even after restarting the SVN client application).</p>
    <p id="p_rg3_dgk_54b">An item that can be committed has one of the following states: <i>added</i>, <i>modified</i>
      (content or properties), <i>replaced</i>, and <i>deleted</i>. All items that have one of these
      states are selected in the dialog box by default. If you do not want to commit one of the
      items, deselect it.</p>
    <note type="attention" id="svn1_8_commit_moved_renamed_items">For SVN 1.8 working copies: when
      committing items that were moved and/or renamed, make sure you select both the source and the
      destination. Otherwise, the commit operation will fail.</note>
    <p id="p_sg3_dgk_54b">Besides the items that have one of the mentioned states, Syncro SVN Client also includes the
      files being <i>unversioned</i> or <i>missing</i> and these items are handled automatically:<ul id="ul_tg3_dgk_54b">
        <li id="li_ug3_dgk_54b"><i>Unversioned</i> items are added under version control.</li>
        <li id="li_vg3_dgk_54b"><i>Missing</i> items are deleted.</li>
      </ul><note id="note_wg3_dgk_54b">If the <uicontrol>Show unversioned directories content</uicontrol> option is not
        selected, the <uicontrol>Commit</uicontrol> dialog box does not display the items inside an
          <i>unversioned</i>directory.</note></p>
    <p id="p_xg3_dgk_54b"><i>Unversioned</i> or <i>missing</i> items are not selected by default in the
        <uicontrol>Commit</uicontrol> dialog box, unless you have selected them explicitly when
      issuing the commit command.</p>
    <note id="note_yg3_dgk_54b">In some cases, items that have one of the above states are not presented in the
        <uicontrol>Commit</uicontrol> dialog box.<p id="p_zg3_dgk_54b">For example:<ul id="ul_ah3_dgk_54b">
          <li id="li_bh3_dgk_54b">Items that have been <i>added</i> or <i>replaced</i> previously, but now are presented
            as <i>missing</i> after being removed from the file system, outside of an SVN client.
            Such items do not exist in the repository and you should use the
              <uicontrol>Delete</uicontrol> action to remove them from your working copy.</li>
          <li id="li_ch3_dgk_54b">Items that have incoming changes from the repository, after a synchronization. You
            need to have your working copy up-to-date before committing your changes.</li>
          <li id="li_dh3_dgk_54b">Files that, after a synchronization, appear as locked by other users or from other
            locations than the current working copy.</li>
        </ul></p></note>
    <note id="note_eh3_dgk_54b">Due to dependencies between items, when you select or clear an <i>unversioned</i> ( <image
        href="../img/SVNWCUnversioned10.png" id="image_qh3_wy5_5r"/> ) or <i>added</i> ( <image
        href="../img/SVNWCAdded10.png" id="image_ejc_sjp_5r"/> ) item in the
        <uicontrol>Commit</uicontrol> dialog box, other items with one of these states can be
      selected or cleared automatically. </note>
    <p id="p_fh3_dgk_54b">The modifications that will be committed for each file can be reviewed in the compare editor
      window by double-clicking a file in the <uicontrol>Commit</uicontrol> dialog box, or by
      right-clicking and selecting the <uicontrol>Show Modifications</uicontrol> action from the
      contextual menu. This option is available to review only file content changes, not property
      changes.</p>
    <p id="p_gh3_dgk_54b">The <uicontrol><image href="../img/SVNLocalContentStatusColumnHeader.png"/>Local file
        status</uicontrol> column indicates the actual state of the items and the <uicontrol><image
          href="../img/SVNLocalPropertiesStatusColumnHeader.png"/>Local properties
        status</uicontrol> column indicates whether or not the properties of an item are
      modified.</p>
    <p id="p_hh3_dgk_54b">The <uicontrol><image href="../img/SVNLockColumnHeader.gif" id="image_pkh_4r1_tc"/>Lock
        information</uicontrol> column is displayed if at least one of the files in the
        <uicontrol>Commit</uicontrol> dialog box has lock information associated with it, valid
      against the commit operation.</p>
    <p id="p_ih3_dgk_54b">The following options are available in this dialog box:<ul id="ul_jh3_dgk_54b">
        <li id="enable-auto-properties"><uicontrol>Enable automatic properties</uicontrol> or
            <uicontrol>Disable automatic properties</uicontrol> - enables or disables automatic
          property assignment (per runtime configuration rules), overriding the
            <codeph>enable-auto-props</codeph> runtime configuration directive, defined in the
            <codeph>config</codeph> file of the Subversion configuration directory.<note id="note_kh3_dgk_54b">This option
            is available only when there are defined properties to be applied automatically for
            resources newly added under version control. You can define these properties in the
              <codeph>config</codeph> file of the Subversion configuration directory, in the
              <codeph>auto-props</codeph> section. Based on the value of the
              <codeph>enable-auto-props</codeph> runtime configuration directive, the presented
            option is either <uicontrol>Enable automatic properties</uicontrol>, or
              <uicontrol>Disable automatic properties</uicontrol>.</note></li>
        <li id="li_lh3_dgk_54b"><uicontrol>Keep locks</uicontrol> - selecting the <uicontrol>Keep locks</uicontrol>
          option preserves any locks you set on various files.<note id="note_mh3_dgk_54b">This option is available only
            when files that you locked are presented in the dialog box.</note></li>
      </ul></p>
    <p id="p_nh3_dgk_54b">Each of the above options is activated only when you select an item that can have the option applied.</p>
    <p id="p_oh3_dgk_54b">Your working copy must be up-to-date with respect to the resources you commit. This is
      ensured by using the <uicontrol>Update</uicontrol> action prior to committing, resolving
      conflicts and re-testing as needed. If your working copy resources you are trying to commit
      are out of date you will get an appropriate error message.</p>
