    <p>Clicking on <uicontrol>Files</uicontrol> in the left stripe opens the <uicontrol>Task
        Files</uicontrol> page that lists all the files that are attached to the task.</p>

    <p>You can click on a file to open it in the visual editor. If other people have the file open,
      you will see their avatars next to the file. You can hover over an avatar to see the name of
      the person.</p>
    <p>If the <xref href="cf-concurrent-editing.dita"><b>Concurrent Editing</b> feature</xref> is
      enabled for a particular task, multiple people can work on the same file simultaneously.
      Otherwise, only one person can edit the file at once. If someone else is currently editing the
      particular file, you will see a <uicontrol><image href="../img/CF_Lock20.png"
          id="image_osm_j1p_zxb"/>Lock</uicontrol> icon on the left side of the
        <uicontrol>Files</uicontrol> box and that person's avatar will have a red border. When a
      file is locked, no one else can edit the file until that person navigates out of the visual
      editor, closes the browser, or uses the <uicontrol>Finalize My Review</uicontrol> button. If
      you hover over the lock icon, it will show you who has the file locked.</p>
    <p>To refresh the list of files, click the <uicontrol><image href="../img/CF-Refresh16.png"
          id="image_tqd_n1g_wr1"/>Refresh</uicontrol> button on the right side of the Files
      header.</p>
    <p>To download the task, click the <uicontrol><image href="../img/CF-Download16.png"
          id="image_h4t_tbp_zxb"/>Download</uicontrol> button. This downloads a zip archive that
      contains all task files, along with change history downloaded as a Git working directory
      (making changes traceable). To inspect the history, extract the archive and open the root
      directory in your Git client. Information about the email and author name of the person who
      made the change in <b>Content Fusion</b> is included.</p>
    <p id="p_ztk_f2y_lcc">To upload a file to the task, click the <uicontrol><image
          href="../img/cf-upload16.png"/>Upload</uicontrol> button. This opens the system file
      browser where you can select the file to upload.</p>
    <p id="p_dbm_ffy_lcc">The <xref
        href="content_fusion_task_details.dita#content_fusion_task_details/section_cmw_vby_lcc"
        >review task header stripe (just below the upper stripe)</xref> contains useful information
      and actions for the particular review task. The components in this header stripe remain
      persistent regardless of the page you navigate to within the review task.  </p>
