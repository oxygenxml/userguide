  <title>Replacing a Floating License Key </title>
  <body>
    <p>The following procedure assumes that your <ph keyref="product"/> floating license servlet
      contains a previously <xref
        href="../tasks/floating-license-servlet-setup.dita#floating-license-servlet-setup/activate-li"
        >activated license key</xref>. The following procedure contains instructions for replacing
      the activated license key with another one. The goal of the procedure is to minimize the
      license servlet down-time during the activation step of the new license key.</p>
    <p>This is useful if, for instance, you want to upgrade your existing license to the latest
      version or if you receive a new license key <xref
        href="installation-setting-up-license-server.dita#installation-setting-up-license-server/split_combine_floating"
        >that accommodates a different number of users</xref>.</p>
    <p>To replace a floating license key that is activated on your floating license servlet with a
      new one, follow these steps:<ol id="ul_scf_3jt_wr">
        <li>Access the license servlet by following the link provided by the Tomcat Web Application
          Manager page.</li>
        <li>Click the <uicontrol>Replace license key</uicontrol> link. This will take you to a page
          that contains details about the license currently in use.</li>
        <li>Click the <uicontrol>Yes</uicontrol> button to begin the replacement
            procedure.<note>During the replacement procedure, new instances of <ph keyref="product"
            /> cannot be licensed by the servlet.</note></li>
        <li>Paste the new floating license key in the displayed form, then click
            <uicontrol>Submit</uicontrol>. The browser used in the process needs to have Internet
            access.<p>You will be redirected to an online form hosted on the <ph keyref="product"/>
            website. This form is pre-filled with an activation code that uniquely identifies your
            license server deployment and your license key.<note>If, for some reason, your browser
              does not take you to this activation form, refer to the <xref
                href="../tasks/floating-license-servlet-setup.dita#floating-license-servlet-setup/manual_activation_proc"
                >Manual Activation Procedure</xref>. </note></p></li>
        <li>Press <uicontrol>Activate</uicontrol>. <p>If the activation process is successfully
            completed, your license servlet is running using the new license key. You can click
              <uicontrol>View license key</uicontrol> to inspect the license key currently used by
            the license servlet.</p><p>If the activation procedure fails, go to step 1 and click
              <uicontrol>Cancel</uicontrol> to revert to last successfully activated license
            key.</p></li>
      </ol></p>
