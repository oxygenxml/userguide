    <p>The following procedure assumes that your <ph keyref="product"/> HTTP license server contains
      a previously <xref

      removing it completely. </p>
    <p>This is useful if, for instance, you want to upgrade your existing license to the latest
      version or if you receive a new license key <xref

      <title>Replacing a License Key</title>
      <p>To replace a license key that is activated on your HTTP license server with a new one,
        follow these steps:<ol id="ul_scf_3jt_wr">
          <li>Access the license server by following the link provided by the Tomcat Web Application
            Manager page.</li>
          <li>Click the <uicontrol>Replace/Remove license key</uicontrol> link. This will open a
            page that contains details about the license currently in use.</li>
          <li>Click the <uicontrol>Replace</uicontrol> button to begin the replacement
            procedure.</li>
          <li>Paste the new license key in the displayed form, then click
              <uicontrol>Register/Activate</uicontrol>. The browser used in the process needs to
            have Internet access.<p>You will be redirected to an online form hosted on the <ph
                keyref="product"/> website. This form is pre-filled with an activation code that
              uniquely identifies your license server deployment and your license key.<note>If for
                some reason your browser does not take you to this activation form, refer to the
                  <xref
                  href="../topics/floating-license-servlet-setup.dita#floating-license-servlet-setup/manual_activation_proc"
                  >Manual Activation Procedure</xref>. </note></p></li>
          <li>Press <uicontrol>Register/Activate</uicontrol>. <p>If the activation process is
              completed successfully, your license server is now running using the new license key.
              You can click <uicontrol>View license key</uicontrol> to inspect the key currently
              used by the license server.</p></li>
