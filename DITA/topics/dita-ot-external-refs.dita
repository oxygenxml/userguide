  <title>Topic References outside the main DITA Map folder</title>
  <body>
    <p>Referencing to a DITA topic, map or to a binary resource (eg: image) which is located outside
      of the folder where the main DITA Map is located usually leads to problems when publishing the
      content using the DITA Open Toolkit. The DITA OT does not handle well links to topics which
      are outside the directory where the published DITA Map is found. By default it does not even
      copy the referenced topics to the output directory. </p>
    <p>You have the following options:<ol id="ol_mkn_r34_l3">
        <li>Create another DITA Map which is located in a folder path above all referenced folders
          and reference from it the original DITA Map. Then transform this DITA Map instead.</li>
        <li>Edit the transformation scenario and in the <b>Parameters</b> tab edit the
            <uicontrol>fix.external.refs.com.oxygenxml</uicontrol> parameter. This parameter is used
          to specify whether the application tries to fix up such references in a temporary files
          folder before the DITA Open Toolkit is invoked on the fixed references. The fix up has no
          impact on your edited DITA content. Only "false" and "true" are valid values. The default
          value is false.</li>
      </ol></p>
