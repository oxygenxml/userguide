    <p id="p_o2t_pl3_vxb"><ph keyref="product"/> offers the ability to connect to an existing Git
      repository that has a DITA project as its source. This is managed within the Content Fusion
      browser interface through a feature known as <term>Projects</term>. Users with a <i>Content
        Fusion Author</i> role can create review tasks inside a project and reviewers' suggestions
      are tracked on a dedicated branch in the Git repository. You can also use the
        <term>Projects</term> feature to build and configure deliverables for creating PDF or <xref
        href="https://www.oxygenxml.com/xml_webhelp/webhelp_responsive.html" format="html"
        scope="external"><b>Oxygen WebHelp Responsive</b></xref> output. Projects also provide
      access to the <xref href="cf-projects-workspace.dita"><term>personal workspace</term>
        feature</xref> that allows authors to make changes across multiple files within a project
      and then commit them to the project.</p>

      <title>User Roles</title>
      <p>When working with projects, there are two user roles:<ul>
          <li><b>Subject Matter Expert (SME)</b> - By default, Content Fusion users have the Subject
            Matter Expert (SME) role assigned. This role allows the user to access review tasks
            assigned to them and to create review tasks from scratch.</li>
          <li><b>Content Fusion Author</b> - This role must be assigned to a user by an
            administrator. In addition to the features that an SME has access to, Content Fusion
            Authors can access all projects and are able to create review tasks inside projects, as
            well as other functionality that is restricted from an SME. They also have access to the
              <xref href="wa-ai-positron.dita"><uicontrol>AI Positron Assistant</uicontrol></xref>
            that provides various ways to use AI-generated content or suggestions while editing or
            reviewing content.</li>
        </ul></p>
      <p>The license for Content Fusion covers a number of user-based licenses for authors and a
        number of floating licenses for SMEs. A system administrator can assign roles from the <xref
          href="cf-enterprise-configuration.dita">Administration page</xref>.</p>
