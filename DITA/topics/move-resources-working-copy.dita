    <p>As in the case of the copy command, you can move several resources at once. Select the
      resources in the <xref href="working-copy-view.dita"><uicontrol>Working Copy</uicontrol>
        view</xref> and choose the <uicontrol>Move to</uicontrol> action from the contextual menu.
      The move command actually behaves as if a copy followed by a delete command were issued. You
      will find the moved resources at the desired destination and also at their original location,
      but marked as <term>deleted</term>.<note id="move_rename_externals_note"><term>External</term>
        items cannot be moved using the <uicontrol>Move to</uicontrol> action, because they cannot
        be deleted. Instead, you should edit the <codeph>svn:externals</codeph> property defining the
          <term>external</term> item and use the <uicontrol>Update</uicontrol> operation on the
        item's parent folder for the change to take effect.</note><note
