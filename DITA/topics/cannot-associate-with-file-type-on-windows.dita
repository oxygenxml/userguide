  <title>I Cannot Associate <ph keyref="product"/> With a
    File Type on My Windows Computer</title>
  <body>
    <section>
      <p>I cannot associate the <ph keyref="product"/> application with a file type on my Windows
        computer by right clicking on a file in Windows Explorer, selecting <menucascade>
          <uicontrol>Open With</uicontrol>
          <uicontrol>Choose Program</uicontrol>
        </menucascade> and browsing to the file <ph keyref="executable"/>. When I select the file
          <ph keyref="executable"/> in the Windows file browser dialog the <ph keyref="product"/>
        application is not added to the list of applications in the <uicontrol>Open With</uicontrol>
        dialog. What can I do?</p>

      <p>The problem is due to some garbage Windows registry entries remained from versions of <ph keyref="product"/> older than version 9.0. Please
        uninstall all your installed versions of <ph keyref="product"/> and run a registry cleaner
        application for cleaning these older entries. After that just reinstall your current version
        of <ph keyref="product"/> and try again to create
        the file association.</p>
