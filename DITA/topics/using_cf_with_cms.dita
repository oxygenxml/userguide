    <p>In addition to its core content management capabilities, <ph keyref="product"/> includes
      integrated review functionality. If you are working with content stored in an external CMS
      (Content Management System), you can also create review tasks using files from that system,
      provided the external CMS has a connector for <b>Oxygen XML Editor/Author</b>. </p>
    <note id="note_qxv_25p_jgc"> External CMS platforms often provide customized versions of
        <b>Oxygen</b>, so some of the methods described below may not be available or may work
      differently depending on your environment. </note>
    <section id="section_rxv_25p_jgc">
      <title>Uploading a Review Task</title>
      <p> To create a review task using files from an external CMS, you have several options: </p>
      <ul id="ul_sxv_25p_jgc">
        <li> Open the file in the editor and use the <uicontrol><image
              href="../img/ShowFusion18.png" id="image_txv_25p_jgc"/>Add File to Review
            Task</uicontrol> action from the contextual menu. </li>
        <li> For DITA resources, open the map in the <uicontrol>DITA Maps Manager</uicontrol> view
          and use the <uicontrol><image href="../img/ShowFusion18.png" id="image_uxv_25p_jgc"/>Add
            File to Review Task</uicontrol> action from the contextual menu. You can also drag map
          entries and drop them in the <uicontrol>New Task</uicontrol> box. </li>
        <li> If available in your customized version of <b>Oxygen</b>, drag resources from the
            <uicontrol>Data Source Explorer</uicontrol> view and drop them in the <uicontrol>New
            Task</uicontrol> box. </li>
        <li id="li_twt_dgk_54b">If you have a special view for exploring the server that contains
          documents on your CMS, you can also drag resources from that view and drop them in the
            <uicontrol>New Task</uicontrol> box.</li>
      </ul>

      <title>Specifying the Root DITA Map</title>
      <p id="p_uwt_dgk_54b">If you choose to add the files to the task from <uicontrol>DITA Maps
          Manager</uicontrol>, the root map that is specified in the <uicontrol>DITA Maps
          Manager</uicontrol> is automatically added as the Context DITA Map. Otherwise, if you work
        with DITA projects, you should manually add the root DITA map to the task.</p>
