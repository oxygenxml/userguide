  <body>
    <p>The <b>Oxygen AI Positron Assistant Enterprise</b> plugin for Eclipse provides advanced
      support for technical documentation writers throughout their content creation process by using
      a company-specific AI service (by configuring your company's specific <b>OpenAI</b> key,
        <b>Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service</b> connection, or <b>Anthropic Claude</b>).</p>
    <section id="overview">
      <title>Overview</title>
      <p id="p_mms_dm5_pyb">In a simplified form, technical documentation is often done in two
        stages: analysis and implementation. In the analysis stage, technical writers could use
        various resources such as web searches, ChatGPT, or discussions with colleagues or engineers
        to further understand the subject that needs to be documented. In the second stage,
        technical writers would use tools such as <b>Oxygen XML Editor/Author/Developer</b> to write
        the actual content.</p>
      <p id="p_nms_dm5_pyb">The <uicontrol>Oxygen AI Positron Assistant Enterprise</uicontrol>
        plugin provides various ways to use AI services (such as ChatGPT) to help writers while
        editing or reviewing the technical documentation. For example, it can be used to receive
        hints about what to write next, improve the readability of content, or re-structure the
        content in various ways.</p>
      <p>
        <note id="note_qpr_zj4_2xb">Content received from the AI model may be inaccurate or contain
          misleading information, so it needs to be thoroughly reviewed and revised
          accordingly.</note>

      <p>You can also start chatting with the AI directly in the chat box at the bottom of the view,

      <p>The response is received from the server in streaming mode (the AI sends chunks of the
        response as it is being generated rather than waiting to send the entire response after it
        is generated). When the AI returns XML, Markdown, or JSON content, the response area has the
        appropriate syntax highlights, depending on the type of content received. You can open links

      <p>The <uicontrol><image href="../img/ai-record18.png" id="image_cgj_cz3_zyb"
          />Record</uicontrol> button in the top-left corner of the view allows you to create new AI
        actions. It opens the <uicontrol>Record examples for instructions</uicontrol> dialog box
        where you can provide a set of instructions that are intended for the AI to follow. Then,
        after clicking the <uicontrol>Start recording</uicontrol> button at the bottom of the dialog
        box, you can record a collection of examples in the editing area that will help the AI
        better follow the given instructions. The examples are recorded from the changes made in the
        open editors. </p>
      <p>After providing examples, you need to click the <uicontrol><image
            href="../img/ai-stop-record18.png" id="image_dgj_cz3_zyb"/>Record</uicontrol> button
        again to stop the recording. You will then have the opportunity to save the final result as
        either a Positron action or as a favorite chat prompt.</p>
      <p>For example, if you want to add DITA markup to menu cascades, you can follow these
          steps:<ol id="ol_egj_cz3_zyb">
          <li>Click the <uicontrol><image href="../img/ai-record18.png" id="image_fgj_cz3_zyb"
              />Record</uicontrol> button.</li>
          <li>In the <uicontrol>Record examples for instructions</uicontrol> dialog box, enter some
            instructions like: <i>You are a technical writer. Add DITA markup to menu
            cascades.</i></li>
          <li>Click <uicontrol>Start recording</uicontrol>.</li>
          <li>Open a DITA topic that has a menu cascade without markup (for example: <codeph>File >
              Export</codeph>).</li>
          <li>Edit the topic and add markup, transforming it to:
            <codeblock outputclass="language-xml" id="codeblock_ggj_cz3_zyb">&lt;menucascade>
  &lt;uicontrol>File&lt;/uicontrol>
  &lt;uicontrol>Export&lt;/uicontrol>
&lt;/menucascade></codeblock></li>
          <li>Click the <uicontrol><image href="../img/ai-stop-record18.png" id="image_hgj_cz3_zyb"
              />Record</uicontrol> button again to stop the recording. The system generates the
            following instructions with
            examples:<codeblock outputclass="language-xml" id="codeblock_igj_cz3_zyb">You are a technical writer. Add DITA markup to a menu cascades.
