    <title>Grey Window on Linux With the Compiz / Beryl Window Manager</title>
    <body>
        <section>
            <p>I try to run <ph keyref="product"/>
                on Linux with the Compiz / Beryl window manager but I get only a grey window which does
                not respond to user actions. Sometimes the <ph 
                    keyref="product"/>
                window responds to user actions but after opening and closing an <ph
                    keyref="product"/>
                dialog or after resizing the <ph 
                    keyref="product"/>
                window or a view of the <ph 
                    keyref="product"/>
                window the content of this window becomes grey and it does not respond to user
                actions. What is wrong?</p>

                    scope="external" format="html">does not support the Compiz window manager and
                    the Beryl one very well</xref>. It is expected that better support for Compiz /
                Beryl will be added in future versions of their Java virtual machine. You should
                turn off the special effects of the Compiz / Beryl window manager before starting
                the <ph 
                    keyref="product"/>
                application or switch to other window manager.</p>
