  <title>How to Remove 'on page NNN' Link Label</title>
  <body>
    <p>For printed material, it is usually desirable for the links to display a label after the text
      content (such as "on page 54"). This makes it easier the user to identify the target page.
      However, if the produced PDF is not printed and is intended only for electronic use, this
      label may create clutter and make the document harder to read. To eliminate this label, add
      the following in your <xref href="dcpp_the_customization_css.dita">customization
      CSS</xref>:</p>
    <codeblock outputclass="language-css">*[class ~= "topic/xref"][href]:after,
*[class ~= "topic/link"][href]:after {
    content: none;
}</codeblock>
    <p>Another use-case is to remove the labels only from links shown in tables cells, and leave the
      others as they are. For this, you could use a more specific selector:</p>
    <codeblock outputclass="language-css">*[class ~= "topic/entry"] *[class ~= "topic/xref"][href]:after{
    content: none;
}</codeblock>
  </body>
</topic>
