    <title>How to Install a TEI Framework with the Latest Schema and Stylesheets</title>
    <taskbody><context>
        
      <p>The TEI framework that is bundled in <ph keyref="product"/> has the TEI schema and
        stylesheets that were available at the time of its release. When the <i>TEI Consortium</i>
        releases a new TEI version (Schema and Stylesheets), they also release a new version of the
          <ph keyref="product"/> TEI framework with them.</p>
      <note type="warning"><i>TEI Consortium</i>, who maintains these releases, chose to keep them
        compatible with <ph keyref="product"/> version 18.1. This means that some features or
        improvements that were developed in later versions of <ph keyref="product"/> might be
        missing from these frameworks.</note>
            <p id="p_dfk_cgk_54b">The following procedure describes how to install a release of the
        TEI framework done by <i>TEI Consortium</i> that has a newer version of the TEI Schema and
