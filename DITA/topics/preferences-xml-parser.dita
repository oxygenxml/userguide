    <p>To configure the <uicontrol>XML Parser</uicontrol> options, <ph
        conkeyref="reusables-preferences-pages/open-the-preferences-page"/> and go to <menucascade>
        <uicontrol>XML</uicontrol>
        <uicontrol>XML Parser</uicontrol>
      </menucascade>.</p>
    <p>The configurable options of the built-in XML parser are as follows:<dl>
        <dlentry>
          <dt><uicontrol>Enable parser caching (validation and content completion)</uicontrol></dt>
          <dd>Enables re-use of internal models when validating and provides content completion in
            opened XML files that reference the same schemas (grammars) such as DTD, XML Schema, or
            RelaxNG.</dd>
        </dlentry>
        <dlentry>
          <dt><uicontrol>Ignore the DTD for validation if a schema is specified</uicontrol></dt>
          <dd>Forces validation against a referenced schema (W3C XML Schema, Relax NG schema) even
            if the document includes also a DTD DOCTYPE declaration. This option is useful when the
            DTD declaration is used only to declare DTD entities and the schema reference is used
            for validation against a W3C XML Schema or a Relax NG schema.<note>Schematron schemas
              are treated as additional schemas. The validation of a document associated with a DTD
              and referencing a Schematron schema is executed against both the DTD and the
              Schematron schema, regardless of the value of the <uicontrol>Ignore the DTD for
                validation if a schema is specified</uicontrol> option.</note></dd>
        </dlentry>
        <dlentry id="enable-xinclude">
          <dt><uicontrol>Enable XInclude processing</uicontrol></dt>
          <dd>Enables XInclude processing. If selected, the XInclude support in <ph keyref="product"
            /> is turned on for validation<ph product="author authorEclipse editor editorEclipse">,
              rendering in <uicontrol>Author</uicontrol> mode</ph> and transformation of XML
            documents.</dd>
        </dlentry>
        <dlentry>
          <dt><uicontrol>Base URI fix-up</uicontrol></dt>
          <dd>According to the specification for XInclude, processors must add an
              <codeph>xml:base</codeph> attribute to elements included from locations with a
            different base URI. Without these attributes, the resulting infoset information would be
              incorrect.<p>Unfortunately, these attributes make XInclude processing to not be
              transparent to Schema validation. One solution to this is to modify your schema to
              allow <codeph>xml:base</codeph> attributes to appear on elements that might be
              included from different base URIs.</p><p>If the addition of <codeph>xml:base</codeph>
              and / or <codeph>xml:lang</codeph> is not desired by your application, you can
              deselect this option.</p></dd>
        </dlentry>
        <dlentry>
          <dt><uicontrol>Language fix-up</uicontrol></dt>
          <dd>The processor will preserve language information on a top-level included element by
            adding an <codeph>xml:lang</codeph> attribute if its include parent has a different
            [language] property. If the addition of <codeph>xml:lang</codeph> is not allowed by your
            application, you can deselect this option.</dd>
        </dlentry>
        <dlentry>
          <dt><uicontrol>DTD post-validation</uicontrol></dt>
          <dd>Select this option to validate an XML file against the associated DTD, after all the
            content merged to the current XML file using <codeph>XInclude</codeph> was resolved. If
            you deselect this option, the current XML file is validated against the associated DTD
            before all the content merged to the current XML file using <codeph>XInclude</codeph> is
            resolved.</dd>
        </dlentry>
