    <title>The Outline View</title>
    <body>
        <p>The <uicontrol>Outline</uicontrol> view displays a general tag overview of the currently
      edited XML Document. It also shows the correct hierarchical dependencies between elements.
      That makes it easier for you to be aware of the document structure and the way element tags
      are nested. It allows fast navigation of the document by displaying the start of the content
      of the child elements in the node of the parent element thus allowing to see quickly the
      content of an element without expanding it in the <uicontrol>Outline</uicontrol> tree. It also
      allows the user to insert or delete nodes using pop-up menu actions.</p>
        <p>The outline view has the following functions: XML document overview, outliner filters,
            modification follow-up, document structure change, document tag selection.</p>
        <p>The upper part of the view contains a filter box which allows you to focus on the
            relevant components. Type a text fragment in the filter box and only the components that
            match it are presented. For advanced usage you can use wildcards (*, ?) and separate
            multiple patterns with commas.</p>
