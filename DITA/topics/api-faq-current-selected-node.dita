  <title>Obtain the Current Selected Element Using the Author API</title>
  <body>
    <section>
      <title>Question</title>
      <p>If in the <uicontrol>Author</uicontrol> mode, an element is fully selected, I would like to
        perform an action on it. If not, I would like to perform an action on the node which is
        located at the caret position. Is this possible via the API?</p>

      <title>Answer</title>
      <p>When an element is fully selected by the user the selection start and end offsets are
        actually outside of the node's offset bounds. So using
          <apiname>AuthorDocumentController.getNodeAtOffset</apiname> will actually return the
        parent of the selected node. We have some special API which makes it easier for you to
        determine this situation:
        <apiname>WSAuthorEditorPageBase.getFullySelectedNode()</apiname>.</p>
      <p>
        <codeblock outputclass="language-java">AuthorDocumentController controller = authorPageAccess.getDocumentController();
AuthorAccess authorAccess = authorPageAccess.getAuthorAccess();
int caretOffset = authorAccess.getEditorAccess().getCaretOffset();

AuthorElement nodeAtCaret = (AuthorElement) authorAccess.getEditorAccess().getFullySelectedNode();
if (nodeAtCaret == null) {
     //We have no fully selected node. We can look at the caret offset.
     nodeAtCaret = (AuthorElement) authorAccess.getDocumentController().getNodeAtOffset(caretOffset);
    //Or we could look at the selection start and end, see which node is the parent of each offset and get the closest common ancestor.
}</codeblock>
