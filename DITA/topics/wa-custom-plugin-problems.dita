  <title>Custom Functionality Added Through a Plugin Has Unintended Results</title>

      <title>Problem</title>
      <p>I have used plugins to customize the behavior of certain functionality in Web Author (for
        example, custom behavior in the toolbar or custom information in side views) and when a
        document is opened from the DITA Map view, the custom functionality does not work as
        expected.</p>
    </condition>
    <troubleSolution>
      <cause id="cause">
        <title>Cause</title>
        <p>Starting with version 21.1.1, functionality was added to open documents in the Web Author
          visual editor without reloading the entire webpage (for example, topics can be opened from
          the DITA Map view without refreshing the page). Some custom functionality added in plugins
          prior to this release might require a page reload to work properly.</p>

        <title>Solution</title>
        <steps-informal>
          <p>To force a page reload whenever a document is opened, disable the <xref
              href="webapp-admin-page.dita#webapp-admin-page/change-editors-without-reload"
                ><uicontrol>Change editors without page reload</uicontrol></xref> option in the
              <xref href="webapp-admin-page.dita"/>. This should be a temporary fix until the plugin
            is updated to account for the changes added to Web Author functionality. Fr more
            information about this, along with some best practice advice for plugin developers, see
              <xref href="wa-plugin-best-practices.dita"/>.</p>
