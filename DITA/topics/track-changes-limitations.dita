    <p>There are some inherent limitations to the change tracking feature. These limitations include
      the following:<ul>
        <li><b>Limitations to rejected changes</b> - Recording changes has limitations and there is
          no guarantee that rejecting all changes will return the document exactly to its original
          state.</li>
        <li><b>Limitations to hierarchical changes</b> - Recorded changes are not hierarchical, a
          change cannot contain other changes inside. For example, if you delete an insertion made
          by another user, then reject the deletion, the information about the author who made the
          previous insertion is not preserved.</li>
        <li><b>Limitations to using certain actions</b> - Some actions cannot be implemented with
          the <uicontrol>Track Changes</uicontrol> feature enabled. For example, some of the
          table-related actions (<uicontrol><image href="../img/DeleteRow16.png"/>Delete
            Row(s)</uicontrol>, <uicontrol><image href="../img/DeleteColumn16.gif"/>Delete
            Column(s)</uicontrol>, <uicontrol><image href="../img/TableJoin16.png"/>Join
            Cells</uicontrol>, <uicontrol><image href="../img/TableSplitCell16.png"/>Split
            Cell</uicontrol>) ignore the <uicontrol>Track Changes</uicontrol> feature when executing
          the action.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
