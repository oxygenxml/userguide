  <title>Searching in Reviews</title>
  <body>
    <p>To perform a search in the edits of your resources, open the <uicontrol>Open/Find
        Resource</uicontrol> dialog or the <uicontrol>Open/Find Resource</uicontrol> view, enable
      the <uicontrol>In reviews</uicontrol> option, and in the search field enter the terms that you
      want to search for.</p>
    <p>The following options are available:<ul>
        <li><uicontrol>Type</uicontrol> - specifies whether you want to search for content in
          comments, insertions, deletions, or highlighted content;</li>
        <li><uicontrol>Author</uicontrol> - displays all the authors of the edits in your resources.
          The authors are collected when indexing. You can set a specific author for your search or
          all of them;</li>
        <li><uicontrol>Time</uicontrol>- specifies the time when the edits that you are searching
          through were created.</li>
      </ul>Both the view and the dialog display the edits that contain the search results and their
      parent topics along with a short description. To hide this description, go to
        <uicontrol>Settings</uicontrol> and disable the <uicontrol>Show Description</uicontrol>
      option.</p>
