    <title>Directories Selector</title>
    <body>
        <p>To open the directories you want to compare, select a folder from each <uicontrol>Browse
        for local directory</uicontrol> button. The Diff Tool keeps track of the folders you are
      currently working with and those you opened in this window. You can see and select them from
      the two combo-boxes.</p>
        <p>If you want to compare two archives' content you can select the archives from the
                <uicontrol>Browse for archive file</uicontrol> button.</p>
        <note type="tip" product="author developer diff editor">By default, the supported archives
      are not treated as directories and the comparison is not performed over the files inside them.
      To make <ph keyref="product"/> treat supported
      archives as directories, go to the <xref href="preferences-diff-files.dita">Diff preferences
        page</xref> and enable the <uicontrol>Look in archives</uicontrol> option.</note>
