  <title>Viewing CHM on a Network Drive</title>
  <body>
    <p>When viewing a CHM on a network drive, if you only see the TOC and an empty page displaying
        <q>Navigation to the webpage was canceled</q> note that this is normal behaviour. The
      Microsoft viewer for CHM does not display the topics for a CHM opened on a network drive.</p>
    <p>As a workaround, copy the CHM file on your local system and view it there.</p>
