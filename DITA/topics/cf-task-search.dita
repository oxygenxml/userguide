    <p>Clicking on <uicontrol>Search</uicontrol> in the left stripe opens the <uicontrol>Search in
        Task</uicontrol> page that allows you to search for specific content in all files attached
      to the task. If a file is open in the visual editor, clicking on <uicontrol>Search</uicontrol>
      opens the page in a side-view to the left of the editor.</p>

    <p>Enter the text you want to search for in the search field at the top of the page. You can
      click on a result to open that file in the visual editor (the <uicontrol>Search in
        task</uicontrol> page becomes a side-view located to the left of the editor). You can click
      on <uicontrol>In reviews</uicontrol> to filter your search query by the author, time, or type
      of content.</p>
