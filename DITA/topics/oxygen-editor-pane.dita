    <title>The Editor Pane</title>
    <body>
        <p>The <term>editor pane</term>, or simply the <term>editor</term>, is where you edit your
      documents opened or created by the <ph keyref="product"/> Eclipse plugin. You know the
      document is associated with <ph keyref="product"/> from the special icon displayed in the
      editor's title bar which has the same graphic pattern painted with different colors for <xref
        href="eclipse-description-of-editor-types.dita">different types of documents.</xref>
    </p>
        <p>This pane has three different modes of displaying and editing the content of a document
      available as different tabs at the bottom left margin of the editor panel: Text mode, Grid
      Mode, <uicontrol>Author</uicontrol> mode (CSS based tagless
      editor).<!--Poate ar trebui amintit si de Design page.--></p>
