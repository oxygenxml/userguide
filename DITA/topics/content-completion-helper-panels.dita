        <p>Information about the current element being edited is also available in various views,
      such as the <uicontrol>Model</uicontrol> view, <uicontrol>Attributes</uicontrol> view,
        <uicontrol>Elements</uicontrol> view, and <uicontrol>Entities</uicontrol> view. By default,
      they are located on the right-hand side of the main editor window. These views, along with the
      powerful <uicontrol>Outline</uicontrol> view, provide spatial and insight information about
      the edited document and the current element.</p>
