  <title>How to Add Support for a New Language</title>
  <body>
    <p>If the <xref href="https://www.dita-ot.org/3.2/topics/globalization-languages.html"
        format="html" scope="external">list of supported languages</xref> does not include the
      language you need, you can create a custom dictionary.</p>
    <p>The DITA-OT documentation offers a good insight on how to do it: <xref
        href="https://www.dita-ot.org/3.2/topics/plugin-addgeneratedtext.html" format="html"
        scope="external"/></p>
    <p>In addition to that, you need to alter CSS files. Some of the labels come from CSS files
      located in the <filepath>[PLUGIN_DIR]/css/print/i18n/</filepath> directory.</p>
    <p>You should use one of the files as a template, copy its rules to your <xref
        href="dcpp_the_customization_css.dita">customization CSS</xref>, and then translate the
      labels. Make sure you also change the <codeph>:lang</codeph> selector to match your language
      code.</p>
