    <p><ph keyref="product"/> provides a simple,
      expressive, and easy to read <uicontrol>Schema Diagram</uicontrol> view for Relax NG
      schemas.</p>
    <p>With this new feature you can easily develop complex schemas, print them on multiple pages or
      save them as JPEG, PNG, or BMP images. It helps both schema authors in developing the schema
      and content authors who are using the schema to understand it.</p>
    <p><ph keyref="product"/> is the only XML editor
      to provide a side by side source and diagram presentation and have them real-time
      synchronized: <ul>
        <li>the changes you make in the Editor are immediately visible in the Diagram (no background
          parsing);</li>
        <li>changing the selected element in the diagram selects the underlying code in the source
          editor.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
