    <p id="p_qqw_s52_vcc">If you encounter conflicts when committing changes or merging branches, a
      convenient conflict resolution dialog box assists you with resolving the conflicts and merging
      the final results.</p>

      <title>Resolving Conflicts Between Your Changes and Incoming Commits</title>
      <p id="p_srv_jjn_ybc">When conflicts are detected between changes in your workspace and
        incoming changes from the project, click the <uicontrol>Resolve conflicts</uicontrol> button
        either from the <uicontrol>Changes</uicontrol> view or the <uicontrol>Incoming
          commits</uicontrol> drop-down. This opens a conflict resolution dialog box.</p>

      <p id="p_bch_v52_vcc">The left pane shows the incoming changes. You can toggle the
          <uicontrol>Show only conflicts</uicontrol> button to filter the list to focus on the
        conflicts. There are three types of incoming changes and each have a dedicated icon:<ul
          id="ul_cch_v52_vcc">
          <li id="li_dch_v52_vcc"><image href="../img/cfConflicts18.png"/> - Conflicting changes

            project that are not present in your workspace.</li>

      <p id="p_gch_v52_vcc">The incoming changes that can be automatically merged (<image
          href="../img/cfMergeableConflicts18.png"/>) and new files coming from the project (<image
          href="../img/cfMergeable18.png"/>) do not require any manual action and will be merged
        when you click the <uicontrol>Pull</uicontrol> button. Conflicting files (<image
          href="../img/cfConflicts18.png"/>) require that you choose an action from the drop-down to
        the right of the file entry. The possible actions are:<ul id="ul_hch_v52_vcc">
          <li id="li_ich_v52_vcc"><uicontrol>Manual merge</uicontrol> - The user must edit the file

            coming from the project and discards your workspace changes.</li>

        document. The current workspace version of the document is displayed on the left while the
        version from the project is displayed on the right. You can use the toolbar buttons to
        navigate through the changes or copy changes from the right to left (from the project to the
        workspace).</p>
      <p id="p_mch_v52_vcc">You can also edit your current workspace version in the left side and it
        includes content completion and contextual menu actions. Note that if you change the
          <uicontrol>Manual merge</uicontrol> option to another type of resolution, your changes are
        discarded.</p>
      <p id="p_nch_v52_vcc">Once you are finished, click the <uicontrol>Pull</uicontrol> button in
        the bottom-right corner to finish the conflict resolution and merge the changes. If you
        close the dialog box without using the <uicontrol>Pull</uicontrol> button, your changes are
        discarded.</p>
