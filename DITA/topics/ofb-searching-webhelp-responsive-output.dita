    <title>Searching WebHelp Responsive Output</title>
    <body>
        <p>When content indexing is enabled for a site's version, the corresponding WebHelp
      Responsive output will use <b>Oxygen Feedback</b> as the search engine when users search the
      published content.</p>
    <p>If content indexing is disabled, the search will be performed using the JS Search Engine
      bundled in the WebHelp Responsive output.</p>
    <p>Search results are ranked based on a complex algorithm used by the search engine to determine
      the relevance of each page to the user's search query. The search engine computes scores for
      every result that matches the search criteria and uses this score to sort the search results.
      The search rank of a page depends on the location and the number of occurrences of the
      searched terms in the content. </p>
    <p>The search ranking order, sorted by relevance is determined by the following locations:<ol
        id="ol_zmz_vyn_zyb">
        <li>Page Title, Keywords &amp; index terms</li>
        <li>Short description and section headings (H1 to H6)</li>
        <li>Bold text</li>
        <li>Italic &amp; underlined text</li>
        <li>Plain text</li>
      </ol></p>
    <p>
      <note id="note_mtm_1zn_zyb" type="tip">The <markupname>indexterm</markupname> and
          <markupname>keywords</markupname> DITA elements are an effective way to increase the
        ranking of a page. The terms found in these elements add a lot of weight to the current page
        in the list of search results.</note>
