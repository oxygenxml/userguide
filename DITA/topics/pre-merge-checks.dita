    <p id="p_yl3_dgk_54b">Before performing a merge, it is recommended to make sure that the working copy target item
      is ready for the merge operation. The SVN Client includes a best practices step that checks
      various conditions of the working copy target item to ensure that the merge operation will
      succeed. By selecting the <uicontrol>Perform pre-merge best practices checks of the working
        copy target</uicontrol> option in the first page of the <uicontrol>Merge</uicontrol> wizard,
      the <uicontrol>Pre-merge checks</uicontrol> wizard page is displayed to give you a summary of
      the verified conditions. </p>

    <p id="p_lm3_dgk_54b">Each condition is marked with an icon that represents the state of the condition. The

          is not fulfilled and is mandatory (therefore, the operation cannot proceed until you solve
          the error).</li>
      </ul></p>
    <note type="tip" id="note_pm3_dgk_54b">For each condition state, a message is displayed that gives you additional
      information about the results and, for warning or errors, a hint that explains how you can
      solve them.</note>
    <note type="important" id="note_qm3_dgk_54b">After solving any of the warnings or errors, it is recommended that you
      perform the <i>pre-merge checks</i> again to make sure your new changes are valid.</note>
