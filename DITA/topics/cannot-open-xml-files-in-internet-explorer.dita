  <title>After Installing <ph keyref="product"/> I
    Cannot Open XML Files in Internet Explorer Anymore</title>
  <body>
    <section>
      <p>Before installing <ph keyref="product"/> I
        had no problems opening XML files in Internet Explorer. Now when I try to open an XML file
        in Internet Explorer it opens the file in <ph
          keyref="product"/>. How can I load XML
        files in Internet Explorer again?</p>

    <section>
      <p>XML files are opened in <ph keyref="product"
        /> because Internet Explorer uses the Windows system file associations for opening files and
        you associated XML files with <ph
          keyref="product"/> in the installer panel
        called <uicontrol>File Associations</uicontrol> therefore Internet Explorer opens XML files
        with the associated Windows application.</p>
      <p>By default the association with XML files is disabled in the <ph
          keyref="product"/> installer panel called
          <uicontrol>File Associations</uicontrol>. When you enabled it the installer displayed a
        warning message about the effect that you experience right now.</p>
      <p>For opening XML files in Internet Explorer again you have to set Internet Explorer as the
        default system application for XML files, for example by right-clicking on an XML file in
        Windows Explorer, selecting <menucascade>
          <uicontrol>Open With</uicontrol>
          <uicontrol>Choose Program</uicontrol>
        </menucascade>, selecting IE in the list of applications and selecting the checkbox
          <uicontrol>Always use the selected program</uicontrol>. Also you have to run the following
        command from a command line:</p>
      <screen xml:space="preserve">wscript revert.vbs</screen>
      <p>where <filepath>revert.vbs</filepath> is a text file with the following content:</p>
      <codeblock outputclass="language-java">
  function revert()
    Set objShell = CreateObject("WScript.Shell")
    objShell.RegWrite "HKCR\.xml\", "xmlfile", "REG_SZ"
    objShell.RegWrite "HKCR\.xml\Content Type", "text/xml", "REG_SZ"
  end function
                        
  revert()</codeblock>
