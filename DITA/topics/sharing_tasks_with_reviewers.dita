        <li>In the <uicontrol>Content Fusion Task Manager</uicontrol> view, click on the name of the
          particular task that you want to share. This opens the task details in the <ph

        <li>Click the <uicontrol>Share</uicontrol> button to display a link to the task and click on
          the <uicontrol><image href="../img/CF_Copy18.png"/> Copy</uicontrol> button to copy the
          link to the clipboard.</li>
        <li>Open your email or whatever electronic messaging system your organization uses, paste
