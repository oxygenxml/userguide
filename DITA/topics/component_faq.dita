      <title>Installation and Licensing </title>
      <ol>
        <li>Are there any client requirements beyond the Java VM? <p>Oracle (formerly Sun) Java JRE
            version 1.8. At least 200 MB disk space and 200MB free memory is necessary for the <ph
              keyref="authorComponent"/>.</p></li>
        <li>Does the <ph keyref="authorComponent"/> support multiple documents being open
          simultaneously? What are the licensing ramifications? <p>A single
              <i>AuthorComponentFactory</i> instance can create multiple
              <i>EditorComponentProvider</i> editors that can then be added and managed by the
            developer who customizes the component in a Swing <i>JTabbedPane</i>. A single license
            (floating or user-based) is enough for this.</p><p>If you need to run multiple distinct
            Java processes using the <ph keyref="authorComponent"/>, the current floating license
            model allows for only two concurrent components from the same computer when using the
            HTTP floating license server. An additional started component will take an extra license
            seat. </p></li>
      </ol>

    <section id="functionality">
      <title>Functionality</title>
      <ol>
        <li>What graphic formats can be directly rendered in the <ph keyref="authorComponent"
            />?<p>GIF, JPEG, PNG, BMP and SVG.</p></li>
        <li>Can links be embedded to retrieve (from the server) and &quot;play&quot; other types of
          digital assets, such as audio or video files?<p>You could add listeners to intercept
            clicks and open the clicked links. This would require a good knowledge of the <i>Oxygen
              SDK</i>. The <ph keyref="authorComponent"/> can only render static images (no GIF
            animations). </p></li>
        <li>Does the <ph keyref="authorComponent"/> provide methods for uploading ancillary files
          (new graphics, for instance) to the hosting server? <p>No.</p></li>
        <li>Does the <ph keyref="authorComponent"/> provide any type of autosave functionality?<p>By
            default no, but you could customize it to save its content periodically to a file on
            disk.</p></li>
        <li>Assuming multiple documents can be edited simultaneously, can content be copied, cut,
          and pasted from one <ph keyref="authorComponent"/> &quot;instance&quot; to
            another?<p>Yes.</p></li>
        <li>Does the <ph keyref="authorComponent"/> support pasting content from external sources
          (such as a web page or a Microsoft Word document and, if so, to what extent? <p>If no
            customizations are available, the content is pasted as simple text. Customizations are
            provided for the major <term>frameworks</term> (DITA, DocBook, TEI, etc.) that use a
            conversion XSLT stylesheet to convert HTML content from clipboard to the target
          XML.</p></li>
        <li>Can UTF-8 characters (such as Greeks, mathematical symbols, etc.) be inserted and
          rendered? <p>Any UTF-8 character can be inserted and rendered, provided that the font used
            for editing supports rendering the characters. The font can be changed by developers but
            not by the users. When using a logical font (by default, <i>Serif</i> for the <ph
              keyref="authorComponent"/>), the JVM will know how to map all characters to glyphs.
            There is no character map available but you could implement one.</p></li>

    <section id="customization">
      <title>Customization</title>
      <ol>
        <li>Describe, in general terms, the menus, toolbars, contextual menu options, helper panes,
          and so on, that are available for the <ph keyref="authorComponent"/> out-of-the box.
            <p>You can mount all actions available in the standalone <ph keyref="product"/>
            application on your custom toolbar. This includes custom actions defined in the
              <term>framework</term> customized for each XML type. </p><p>The <ph
              keyref="authorComponent"/> also can provide the <xref
              href="author-outline-view.dita#author-outline-view"
              ><uicontrol>Outline</uicontrol></xref>, <xref href="model-panel.dita#model-panel"
                ><uicontrol>Model</uicontrol></xref>, <xref
              href="author-elements-view.dita#author-elements-view"
              ><uicontrol>Elements</uicontrol></xref>, and <xref
              href="author-attributes-view.dita#author-attributes-view"
                ><uicontrol>Attributes</uicontrol></xref> views that can be added to your own
            panels.</p></li>
        <li>Describe, in general terms, the actions, project resources (for example, DTD/Schema for
          validation purposes, CSS/XSL for styling, etc.) and typical level of effort that would be
          required to deploy a <ph keyref="authorComponent"/> solution for a customer with a
          proprietary DTD.<p>The <uicontrol>Author</uicontrol> mode internal engine uses CSS to
            render XML. </p><p>For a special type of XML, you can create a custom
              <term>framework</term> (which also works in an <ph keyref="product"/> standalone
            version) that would also contain default schemas and custom actions. A simple
              <term>framework</term> would probably need 2-3 weeks development time. For a complex
              <term>framework</term> with many custom actions, it could take a long time. <ph
              keyref="product"/> already has <term>frameworks</term> for editing (DocBook, DITA,
            TEI, etc.) and sources for them are available in <xref
              href="https://www.oxygenxml.com/developer.html#XML_Editor_Authoring_SDK" format="html"
              scope="external"> the Oxygen SDK</xref>.</p><p>Multiple <term>frameworks</term> can
            co-exist in the same <ph keyref="product"/> instance and can be used at the same time
            for editing XML documents.</p></li>
        <li>Many customers desire a very simplistic interface for contributors (with little or no
          XML expertise) but a more robust XML editing environment for editors (or other users with
          more advanced XML expertise). How well does the <ph keyref="authorComponent"/> support
          varying degrees of user interface complexity and capability?<p>
            <ul>
              <li><i>Showing/hiding menus, toolbars, helpers, etc.</i>
                <p>You assemble all the UI parts from the <ph keyref="authorComponent"/>. For
                  example, you could provide two implementations: one for advanced users and one for
                  content authors.</p></li>
              <li><i>Forcing behaviors (for example, ensuring <xref
                    keyref="glossentry_track-changes">change tracking</xref> is on and preventing it
                  from being shut down).</i>
                <p>You could avoid placing the <term>change tracking</term> toolbar actions in the
                  UI. You could also use the API to turn <term>change tracking</term> ON when the
                  content has been loaded.</p></li>
              <li><i>Preventing access to &quot;privileged&quot; editor processes (for example,
                  accept/reject changes).</i>
                <p>You can remove the <term>change tracking</term> actions completely in a custom
                  implementation, including the ones from the contextual menu.</p></li>
              <li><i>Presenting and/or describing XML constructs (for example, tags) in
                  &quot;plain-English&quot;.</i>
                <p>Using our API, you can customize what the Outline view or Breadcrumb displays for
                  each XML tag. You can also customize the in-place content completion
                list.</p></li>
              <li><i>Presenting a small subset of the overall XML tag set (rather than the full tag
                  set) for use by contributors (for example, allowing an author to only insert
                  Heading, Para, and inline emphasis).</i><p>The API allows for a content completion
                  filter that also affects the <i>Elements</i> view.</p></li>
            </ul>
          </p></li>
        <li>Does the <ph keyref="authorComponent"/> API provide access to the XML document, for
          manipulation purposes, using common XML syntax (such as DOM, XPath, etc.)? <p>Yes, using
            the <ph keyref="authorComponent"/> API.</p></li>
        <li>Can custom dialog boxes be developed and launched to collect information in a
          &quot;form&quot; (with scripting behind to push tag the collection information and embed
          it in the XML document)? <p>Yes.</p></li>
        <li>Can project resources and customizations be readily shared between the desktop and
          component versions of your <ph keyref="authorComponent"/> product line?<p>A
              <term>framework</term> developed for the standalone version of the <ph
              keyref="product"/> application can then be bundled with the <ph
              keyref="authorComponent"/>. For example, you could use the same <term>framework</term>
            that you use in the <ph keyref="product"/> standalone distribution. </p><p>A custom
            editing solution can deploy one or more <term>frameworks</term> that can be used at the
            same time.</p></li>
