    <p><ph keyref="webappProduct"/> uses a floating license mechanism, where the license key is stored on a
      server and individual users consume license seats from a common pool. To run properly, be
      aware of the following:</p>
    <p>
      <ul id="ul_esd_1wr_1r">
        <li>For the licensing mechanism to run properly, your browser needs to accept
          cookies. Otherwise, <ph keyref="webappProduct"/> will not be loaded.</li>
        <li>Each browser consumes a license. When you use multiple browsers (for example,
          Firefox and Chrome) to access the <ph keyref="webappProduct"/> at the same time on the same
          system, you will consume multiple licenses. However, multiple tabs in the same browser
          consume a single license.</li>
        <li>A license is automatically released after 30 minutes of inactivity. When resuming work,
          if there are no available licenses, you can still save the documents you are currently
          working on.</li>
        <li>On desktop systems, you may force an immediate license release by closing all editor
          tabs.</li>
      </ul>
