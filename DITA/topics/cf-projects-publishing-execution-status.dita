    <p>The <uicontrol>Execution Status</uicontrol> page displays information about the status of
      deliverables with builds that are pending or in progress. You also have the ability to stop
      builds that are in progress from this page. <note id="note_w4v_1vx_5cc">When a deliverable
        build is complete or if it is manually stopped by a user, its execution details will remain
        in the table. These details will stay visible until the <uicontrol>Execution
          Status</uicontrol> page is refreshed.</note></p>
