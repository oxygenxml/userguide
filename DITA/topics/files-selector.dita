        <p>To open the source and target files where you want to see the differences, use one of the
        <uicontrol>Browse for local</uicontrol>, <uicontrol>Browse for remote</uicontrol> or
        <uicontrol>Browse for archive</uicontrol> buttons. The Diff Tool keeps track of the files
      you are currently working with and those you opened in this window. You can see and select
      them from the two combo-boxes.</p>
        <p>You can also save the changes in the source file or the target file by clicking the
            corresponding "Save" button.</p>
