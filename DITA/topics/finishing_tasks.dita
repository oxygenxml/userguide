    <p>It is highly recommended that you use some sort of mechanism to indicate that the task review
      process is finished in your workflow and all files attached to the task should be reviewed
      before finalizing the task. Otherwise, the <uicontrol>Content Author</uicontrol> may end up
      merging changes more than once and this could result in some complicated conflicts.</p>
    <p>You might have your own preferred method of letting the <b>Content Author</b> know that you
      are finished, but <ph keyref="product"/> also includes a few options to help you.</p>
    <p>
      <dl>
        <dlentry>
          <dt>FINALIZE REVIEW button</dt>
          <dd>From the <xref
              href="content_fusion_user_interface.dita#content_fusion_user_interface/task-details"
              >Task Details page</xref> or <xref
              href="making_changes_to_uploaded_files.dita#making_changes_to_uploaded_files">Oxygen
              XML Web Author editor</xref>, you can use the <uicontrol>Finalize Review</uicontrol>
            button to add a predefined message to the task that lets the <b>Content Author</b> know
            you have reviewed all the files attached and you are finished with the process. You can
            also add an additional optional message to provide more details. </dd>
        </dlentry>
        <dlentry>
          <dt>ADD MESSAGE button</dt>
          <dd>You can click the <uicontrol>Add Message</uicontrol> button to create your own message
            to let the <b>Content Author</b> know that the review process in finished.</dd>
