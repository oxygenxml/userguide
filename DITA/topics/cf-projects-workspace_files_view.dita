    <p><b><u>Managing Folders</u></b></p>
    <p id="p_bqv_cs2_vcc">You can expand or collapse folders similar to any common file browser. To
      add a folder to the workspace, click the 3 vertical dots next to the parent folder and select
        <uicontrol>New Folder</uicontrol>. You can create a folder on the root level by selecting
        <uicontrol>New Folder</uicontrol> from the 3 vertical dots menu in the <i>Files</i> header
      at the top. To delete a folder from the workspace, click the 3 vertical dots next to the
      particular folder and select <uicontrol>Delete folder</uicontrol>.</p>
    <p><b><u>Managing Files</u></b></p>
    <p>You can use the <uicontrol>Filter by name</uicontrol> text field to search for a file by
      name.</p>
    <p>Double-click on a file to open it in the visual editor. Each file that has been opened has a
      tab at the top of the editing pane. You can click the <uicontrol><image
          href="../img/Remove16.png"/>Close</uicontrol> button on the right side of the tab to close
      it. You can also right-click the tab to access additional actions (<uicontrol>Close other
        tabs</uicontrol>, <uicontrol>Close tabs to the left</uicontrol>, <uicontrol>Close tabs to
        the right</uicontrol>).</p>
    <p><b><u>Move or Upload Resources Using Drag and Drop</u></b></p>
    <p id="p_j2w_y15_rcc">You can use drag and drop functionality to move a file or folder (or a
      selection of multiple files or folders) to another location. You can also drag files or
      folders from your local computer and drop them in the Files tree to upload the resources at
      the particular drop location.</p>
    <p><b><u>Move Resources Using Cut/Copy/Paste</u></b></p>
    <p id="p_j2w_y15_rcc3">You can also move files by using <i>Cut</i>, <i>Copy</i>, and
        <i>Paste</i> actions that are found in the contextual menu. You can right-click a resource
      (or a selection of multiple resources) while hovering to access contextual menu actions. Also,
      when hovering over a folder or file, a 3 vertical dots menu appears to the right. It also
      contains the contextual actions for that particular folder or file. If the copied resource is
      pasted in its same original location, the file is automatically renamed by adding a suffix to
      avoid duplicates.</p>

      <note id="note_wpq_ry3_tcc">When moving or renaming files or folders in a DITA XML project,
        the references (links, content references, image references) to or from these files are
        automatically updated so that the overall project remains valid without any broken links.
        The files that are automatically modified for references to remain valid after a move/rename
        operation are listed in the <xref href="cf-projects-workspace_changes_view.dita"/>.</note>
