  <title>Moving a License Server Installation to a New Machine</title>
  <body>
    <p>Sometimes an <uicontrol>Oxygen License Server</uicontrol> deployment needs to be moved to a
      different virtual machine (for example, if your organization is moving to a different cloud
      provider). </p>
    <p>To ensure that you make this transition with minimal impact on <uicontrol>Oxygen</uicontrol>
      users in your organization, follow these steps:</p>
    <p>
      <ol id="ul_j21_5q5_t5b">
        <li>Open the web-based administration page of your existing License Server
          installation.</li>
        <li>Click the <uicontrol>View License</uicontrol> link.</li>
        <li>Send a request to <i>support@oxygenxml.com</i> asking them to deactivate your license.
          This email should include the following information:<ol id="ol_um2_tr5_t5b">
            <li>The license key you obtained in step 2.</li>
            <li>The reason for wanting to move the License Server to a new virtual machine.</li>
          </ol><p>You will receive an email that contains the license key to be activated on the new
            server.</p></li>
        <li>Install the License Server on the new virtual machine.</li>
        <li>Configure the license key your received in step 3 on the new License Server
          installation.</li>
        <li>Perform the required configuration to move all <uicontrol>Oxygen</uicontrol> users to
          the new server.<note id="note_scy_12y_t5b" type="tip">This is typically done by
            configuring the domain name of the License Server to point to the new virtual
            machine.</note></li>
        <li>Uninstall the old License Server.</li>
      </ol>
