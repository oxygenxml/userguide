  <title>Content Completion in Schematron Documents</title>
  <body>
    <p><ph keyref="product"/> helps you edit a Schematron schema, offering, through the Content
      Completion Assistant, items that are valid at the caret position. When you edit the value of
      an attribute that refers a component, the proposed components are collected from the entire
      schema hierarchy. For example, if the editing context is
        <codeph>phase/active/@pattern</codeph>, the Content Completion Assistant proposes all the
      defined patterns.</p>
    <note>For Schematron resources, the Content Completion Assistant collects its components
      starting from the master files. The master files can be defined in the project or in the
      associated validation scenario. For further details about the <uicontrol>Master
        Files</uicontrol> support go to <xref
        href="defining_master_files.dita#defining_master_files">Defining Master Files at Project
        Level</xref>. </note>
    <p>If the editing context is an attribute value that is an XPath expression (like
        <codeph>assert/@test</codeph> or <codeph>report/@test</codeph>), the Content Completion
      Assistant offers the names of XPath functions, the XPath axes, and user-defined variables.</p>
