  <title>Author Component</title>
  <body>
    <p>The Author Component was designed as a separate product to provide the functionality of the
      standard <uicontrol>Author</uicontrol> mode. Recently (in version 14.2), the component API was
      extended to also allow multiple edit modes like <b>Text</b> and <b>Grid</b>. The component can
      be embedded either in a third-party standalone Java application or customized as a Java Web
      Applet to provide WYSIWYG-like XML editing directly in your web browser of choice.</p>
    <p>The Author Component startup project for Java/Swing integrations is available online as a
      Maven archetype on the <b><keyword>&lt;oXygen/> XML Editor</keyword></b> website. More
      information about the setup can be found <xref
