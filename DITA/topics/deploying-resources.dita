  <title>Deploying Resources</title>
  <body>
    <p>You are able to embed the Author component in a SharePoint site as a Java Applet, using the
      new Applet with JNLP Java technology. Sign with a valid certificate the JNLP file and the
      associated JAR files that the applet needs.</p>
    <p>Deploy these resources on a third party server (other than the SharePoint server). The Java
      applet downloads the resources as needed. If you deploy the JNLP and JAR files on the
      SharePoint server, the Java Runtime Environment will not be able to access the applet
      resources because it is not aware of the current authentication tokens from your browser. This
      causes the Java Class Loader to fail loading classes, making the applet unable to start. </p>
