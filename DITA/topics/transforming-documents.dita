    <p>XML documents can be transformed into a variety of user-friendly output formats that can be
      viewed by end users. This process is known as a <i>transformation</i>.</p>
    <p><ph keyref="product"/> includes numerous built-in transformation possibilities to publish XML
      content in various output formats (such as WebHelp, PDF, CHM, EPUB, JavaHelp, Eclipse Help,
      XHTML, etc.) </p>
    <p>For transformations that are not included in your installed version of <ph keyref="product"
      />, simply install the tool chain required to perform the specific transformation and process
      the files in accordance with the processor instructions. A multitude of target formats are
