  <title>Including Document Parts with DTD Entities</title>
  <body>
    <p>There are two conditions for including a part using DTD entities:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>The master document should declare the DTD to be used, while the external entities should
          declare the XML sections to be referred;</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The document containing the section must not define again the DTD.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <example>
      <p>A master document looks like this:</p>
      <codeblock outputclass="language-xml">&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; 
&lt;!DOCTYPE book SYSTEM "../xml/docbookx.dtd" [ 
&lt;!ENTITY testing SYSTEM "testing.xml" &gt; ]
&gt; 
&lt;book&gt; 
&lt;chapter&gt; ...</codeblock>
    </example>
    <p>The referred document looks like this:</p>
    <codeblock outputclass="language-xml">&lt;section&gt; ... here comes the section content ... &lt;/section&gt;</codeblock>
    <note>
      <p>The indicated DTD and the element names (<i>section</i>, <i>chapter</i>) are used here only
        for illustrating the inclusion mechanism. You can use any DTD and element names you
        need.</p>
    </note>
    <p>At a certain point in the master document there can be inserted the section
        <i>testing.xml</i> entity:<codeblock>... &amp;testing; ...</codeblock></p>
    <p>When splitting a large document and including the separate parts in the master file using
      external entities, only the master file will contain the Document Type Definition (the DTD) or
      other type of schema. The included sections can't define again the schema because the main
      document will not be valid. If you want to validate the parts separately you have to <xref href="including-document-parts-with-XInclude.dita">use XInclude</xref> for assembling the
      parts together with the master file.</p>  </body>
