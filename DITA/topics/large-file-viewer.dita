    <p>XML files tend to become larger and larger mostly because they are frequently used as a
      format for database export or for porting between different database formats. Traditional XML
      text editors simply cannot handle opening these huge export files, some having sizes exceeding
      one gigabyte, because all the file content must be loaded in memory before the user can
      actually view it.</p>
    <p>The best performance of the viewer is obtained for encodings that use a fixed number of bytes
      per character, like UTF-16 or ASCII. The performance for UTF-8 is very good for documents that
      use mostly characters of the European languages. For the same encoding, the rendering
      performance is higher for files consisting of long lines (up to few thousands characters) and
      may degrade for short lines. In fact, the maximum size of a file that can be rendered in the
      Large File Viewer decreases when the total number of the text lines of the file increases.
      Trying to open a very large file, for example a file of 4 GB with a very high number of short
      lines (100 or 200 characters per line) may produce an <i>out of memory</i> error
        (<uicontrol>OutOfMemoryError</uicontrol>) which would require either increasing the Java
      heap memory with the <parmname>-Xmx</parmname> startup parameter or decreasing the total
      number of lines in the file.</p>
    <p>The powerful <uicontrol>Large File Viewer</uicontrol> is available from the
        <uicontrol>Tools</uicontrol> menu or as a standalone application. You can also right click a
      file in your project and choose to open it with the viewer. It uses an efficient structure for
      indexing the opened document. No information from the file is stored in the main memory, just
      a list of indexes in the file. In this way the viewer can open very large files, up to 10
      gigabytes. If the opened file is XML, the encoding used to display the text is detected from
      the XML prolog of the file. For other file types, the encoding is taken from the <ph
        keyref="product"/> options. See <xref
        href="preferences-encoding.dita">Encoding for non XML files</xref>.</p>

            search options like:<ul>
              <li><uicontrol>Case sensitive</uicontrol> - When checked, operations are
                case-sensitive.</li>
              <li><uicontrol>Regular Expression</uicontrol> - When checked, allows using any regular
                expression in <i>PERL</i> syntax.</li>
              <li><uicontrol>Wrap around</uicontrol> - Continues the find from the start (end) of
                the document after reaching the end (start) if the search is in forward (backward)
                direction.</li>

      <li>The status bar provides information about the current opened file path, the Unicode
        representation of the character at caret position and the line and column in the opened
        document where the caret is located.</li>
    </ul>
    <note type="attention">For faster computation the <uicontrol>Large File Viewer</uicontrol> uses
      a fixed font (plain, monospace font of size 12) to display characters. The font is <i>not</i>
      configurable from the <ph keyref="product"/>
      <uicontrol>Preferences</uicontrol> page.</note>
