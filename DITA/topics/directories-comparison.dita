    <p>The directories comparison result is presented as a tree of files and directories. The
      directories that contain different files are expanded automatically, so you can focus directly
      on the differences. You can merge the directories contents using the copy actions. A double
      click or an Enter key on a line with a pair of files starts <xref
        href="file-comparison.dita#file-comparison" format="dita">comparing the file content</xref>
      of the two files from that line in the <uicontrol>Compare Files</uicontrol> window. Please
      note that the content is compared only in case of known file types, that is the files
      associated with the built-in editors and the file types associated with a built-in editor when
      the user was prompted to specify such an association (when opening for the first time a file
      of an unknown type).</p>
