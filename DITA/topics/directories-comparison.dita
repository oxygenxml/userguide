    <p>The <uicontrol>Compare Directories</uicontrol> tool can be used to compare and manage changes
      to files and folders within the structure of your directories. <ph
        product="author developer editor">The utility is available from the
          <uicontrol>Tools</uicontrol> menu or can be opened as a stand-alone application from the
          <ph keyref="product"/> installation folder (<filepath>diffDirs.exe</filepath>).</ph>
      <ph product="svnClient">The utility is available as a stand-alone application and can be
        opened by running its executable file (<filepath>diffDirs.exe</filepath>) from the Syncro
        SVN Client installation folder.</ph>
    </p>
    <p>The directories comparison results are presented as a tree of files and directories. The
      directories and folders that contain files that differ are expanded automatically so that you
      can focus directly on the differences. You can merge the contents of the directories by using
      the copy actions. If you double-click (or press
        <uicontrol><shortcut>Enter</shortcut></uicontrol>) on a line with a pair of files, <ph
        keyref="product"/> starts a <xref href="file-comparison.dita#file-comparison" format="dita"
        >file comparison</xref> between the two files, using the <uicontrol>Compare
        Files</uicontrol> tool.</p>

    <p>To perform a directory comparison, follow these steps:<ol>
        <li>Select a folder in the left panel and the folder you want to compare it to in the right
          panel. You can specify the path by using the text field, the history drop-down, or the
            <uicontrol>Browse for local directory</uicontrol> action in the <uicontrol><image
              href="../img/BrowseDrop.png"/>Browse</uicontrol> drop-down menu.<p><b>Step Result:</b>
            The selected directory structures are opened in the two side-by-side panels.</p></li>
        <li>To highlight the differences between the two folders, click the <uicontrol><image
              href="../img/DiffPerform16.png"/>Perform Directories Differencing</uicontrol> button
          from the toolbar.</li>
        <li product="author developer editor">You can also use the <uicontrol><image
              href="../img/OptionsShortcut16.png"/>Diff Options</uicontrol> button to access the
            <xref href="preferences-diff-dirs.dita#preferences-diff-dirs"><uicontrol>Directories
              Comparison</uicontrol> preferences page</xref> where you can configure various
          options.</li>
      </ol></p>
    <p>To compare the content of two archives, follow these steps:<ol>
        <li>Use the <uicontrol>Browse for archive file</uicontrol> action in the <uicontrol><image
              href="../img/BrowseDrop.png"/>Browse</uicontrol> drop-down menu to select the archives
          in the left and right panels.</li>
        <li product="author developer editor">By default, the supported archives are not treated as
          directories and the comparison is not performed on the files inside them. To make <ph
            keyref="product"/> treat supported archives as directories, enable the <xref
            href="preferences-diff-dirs.dita#preferences-diff-dirs/look-in-archives"><uicontrol>Look
              in archives</uicontrol> option</xref> in the <uicontrol>Directories
            Comparison</uicontrol> preferences page.</li>
        <li>To highlight the differences, click the <uicontrol><image
              href="../img/DiffPerform16.png"/>Perform Directories Differencing</uicontrol> button
          from the toolbar.</li>
      </ol></p>
    <p>The directory comparison results are presented using two tree-like structures showing the
      files and folders, including their name, size, and modification date.</p>
    <p>A column that contains graphic symbols separates the two tree-like structures. The graphic
      symbols can be one of the following:<ul>
        <li>An <b>X</b> symbol, when a file or a folder exists in only one of the compared
          directories.</li>
        <li>A <b>≠</b>symbol, when a file exists in both directories but the content differs. The
          same sign appears when a collapsed folder contains differing files. </li>
      </ul><ph product="author developer editor">The color used for the symbol and the directory or
        file name can be customized in the <xref href="preferences-diff-dir-appearance.dita"
            ><uicontrol>Directories Comparison / Appearance</uicontrol> preferences
        page</xref>.</ph> You can double-click lines marked with the <b>≠</b> symbol to open a
        <uicontrol>Compare Files</uicontrol> window, which shows the differences between the two
      files.</p>
