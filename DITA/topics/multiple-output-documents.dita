  <title>Multiple Output Documents in XSLT 2.0 and XSLT 3.0</title>
  <body>
    <p>For XSLT 2.0 and XSLT 3.0 stylesheets that store the output in multiple files by using
      the <codeph>xsl:result-document</codeph> instruction the content of the file created in this
      way is displayed dynamically while the transformation is running in an output view. There is
      one view for each <codeph>xsl:result-document</codeph> instruction so that the output is not
      mixed while still being presented in multiple views.</p>
