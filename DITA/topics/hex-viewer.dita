  <title>Hex Viewer</title>
  <body>
    <p>When the Unicode characters that are visible in a text viewer or editor are not enough and
      you need to see the byte values of each character of a document, you can start the hex viewer
      that is available on the <uicontrol>Tools</uicontrol> menu. It has two panels: the characters
      are rendered in the right panel and the bytes of each character are displayed in the left
      panel. There is a 1:1 correspondence between the characters and their byte representation: the
      byte representation of a character is displayed in the same matrix position of the left panel
      as the character in the matrix of the right panel.</p>

    <p>To open a file in <uicontrol>Hex Viewer</uicontrol> use the <menucascade>
        <uicontrol>File</uicontrol>
        <uicontrol>Open</uicontrol>
      </menucascade> action. Alternatively, you can drag a file and drop it in the <uicontrol>Hex
        Viewer</uicontrol> panel.</p>
