    <p>The <term>personal workspace</term> feature allows you to make changes across multiple files
      within a project and then commit them to the project.</p>
    <p id="p_lg2_4yb_tbc">Once a project is open, an additional stripe is displayed below the top
      stripe with an <uicontrol>Edit in workspace</uicontrol> button that creates a personal
      workspace branch starting from the latest version on the project branch. If a personal
      workspace is already created, invoking the button opens the already existing workspace. You
      can also go straight to the personal workspace from the <xref
        href="cf-projects.dita#cf-projects/projects_main_page">main Projects page</xref>.</p>

    <p id="p_w3v_jzb_tbc">Once inside a personal workspace, the second top stripe changes to make it

        when you click the <uicontrol>Pull</uicontrol> button. Conflicting files (<image

        current workspace version of the document is displayed on the left while the version from
        the project is displayed on the right. You can use the toolbar buttons to navigate through
        the changes or copy changes from the right to left (from the project to the workspace).</p>
      <p>You can also edit your current workspace version in the left side and it includes content
        completion and contextual menu actions. Note that if you change the <uicontrol>Manual
          merge</uicontrol> option to another type of resolution, your changes are discarded.</p>
      <p>Once you are finished, click the <uicontrol>Pull</uicontrol> button in the bottom-right
        corner to finish the conflict resolution and merge the changes. If you close the dialog box
        without using the <uicontrol>Pull</uicontrol> button, your changes are discarded.</p>
