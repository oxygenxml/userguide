      <title>Uploading a Review Task Takes Too Long</title>
      <p>When uploading a review task that contains DITA files, along with the files explicitly
        selected for review, the task also contains the DITA map and all the files referenced from
        it (directly or indirectly). For large projects, this set of files is also large and can
        take a long time to upload.</p>
      <p>To improve the loading time, go to <menucascade>
          <uicontrol>Options</uicontrol>
          <uicontrol>Preferences</uicontrol>
          <uicontrol>Plugins</uicontrol>
          <uicontrol> Oxygen Content Fusion Connector</uicontrol>
      </menucascade> and enable the <uicontrol>Upload only resources that are directly referenced
        in the files to be reviewed.</uicontrol> option.</p>
      <p>When this option is enabled, only resources such as other topics and images that are
        directly referenced from the files to review are uploaded, including all the submaps that
        are referenced in the context DITA map. This may lead to a smaller set of files, but there
        are some limitations:</p>
      <p>
        <ul id="ul_uln_gvd_crb">
          <li>References that use the <xmlatt>conkeyref</xmlatt> attribute are not uploaded.</li>
          <li>References that use the <xmlelement>xref</xmlelement> element will be uploaded and
            reviewers can open them. However, images and other references in these files will not be
            uploaded.</li>
          <li>If the set of files to be reviewed is large, the upload will still take a long
            time.</li>

      <p>While creating a <b>Content Fusion</b> backup using the command line in versions prior to
