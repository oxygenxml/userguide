  <title>Apply Profiling Condition Sets</title>
  <body>
    <p>All defined Profiling Condition Sets are available as shortcuts in the Profiling /
      Conditional Text menu. Just click on a menu entry to apply the condition set. The filtered
      content is grayed-out in Author editor, Outline view and DITA Maps Manager view. An element is
      filtered-out when one of its attributes is part of the condition set and its value does not
      match any of the value covered by the condition set. As an example, let us suppose that you
      have the following document:</p>
    <fig>
      <image href="../img/apply_condition_set_before.png"/>
    </fig>
    <p>If you apply the following condition set it means that you want to filter-out the content
      written for non-expert audience and having the <i>Other</i> attribute value different than
        <i>prop1</i>.</p>
    <fig>
      <image href="../img/expert_user_condition_set.png"/>
    </fig>
    <p>And this is how the document looks like after you apply the <i>Expert user</i> condition
      set:</p>
    <fig>
      <image href="../img/apply_codition_set_after.png"/>
    </fig>
