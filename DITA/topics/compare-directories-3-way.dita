    <p>The <uicontrol>Compare Directories Against a Base (3-way)</uicontrol> tool allows you to
      perform three-way comparisons on directories to help you identify and merge changes between
      multiple modifications of the same directory structure. It is especially helpful for teams
      that have multiple authors contributing documents to the same directory system. It offers
      information about conflicts and changes, and includes actions to easily merge, accept,
      overwrite, or ignore changes to the directory system.</p>

      <title>How to Perform 3-Way Directory Comparisons</title>
      <p>To perform a 3-way directories comparison, follow these steps:<ol>
          <li>Select <uicontrol><image href="../img/DiffDirsThreeWay16.png"/>Compare Directories
              Against a Base (3-way)</uicontrol> from the <uicontrol>Tools</uicontrol>
                menu.<p><b>Step Result:</b> This opens a dialog box that allows you to select the 3
              file sets that will be used for the comparison.</p><p>

              </fig>
            </p></li>
          <li>Select the file sets to be compared:<ul>
              <li><uicontrol>Base directory</uicontrol> - This is the original (base) file set
                before any modifications were made by your or others.</li>
              <li><uicontrol>Directory with your changes</uicontrol> - This is the file set with
                changes that you have made. This file set will be displayed in the left panel in the
                comparison tool.</li>
              <li><uicontrol>Directory with changes made by others</uicontrol> - This is the file
                set with changes made by others that you want to merge with your changes. This file
                set will be displayed in the right panel in the comparison tool.</li>
            </ul></li>
          <li>Click the <uicontrol>Compare</uicontrol> button to compare the file sets and open the
            comparison tool.</li>
          <li>Use the features and actions described in the next section to identify and merge the
            changes.</li>

          two editors are constantly synchronized and the differences are refreshed when you save
          the modified document or when you click the <uicontrol><image
              href="../img/DiffPerform16.png"/>Perform File Differencing</uicontrol> button.</p><p>A
          variety of actions are available in the contextual menu in both editing panes. The tool
          also includes some inline actions to help you merge, copy, or remove changes. When you
          select a change, the following inline action widgets are available, depending on the type
          of change:<dl>
            <dlentry>
              <dt><uicontrol><image href="../img/DiffAppendRightToLeft12.png" placement="inline"/>
                  Append right change to left</uicontrol></dt>
              <dd>Copies the content of the selected change from the right side and appends it on
                the left side.</dd>
            </dlentry>
            <dlentry>
              <dt><uicontrol><image href="../img/DiffCopyRightToLeft12.png" placement="inline"/>
                  Copy change from right to left</uicontrol></dt>
              <dd>Replaces the content of a change in the left side with the content of the change
                in the right side.</dd>
