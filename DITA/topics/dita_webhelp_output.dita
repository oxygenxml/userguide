  <body>
    <p>The <b>WebHelp Responsive</b> variant features a very flexible layout, is designed to adapt
      to any screen size, and is available for DITA document types. The <b>WebHelp Responsive with
        Feedback</b> variant also includes a feedback system that allows your users to make comments
      and allows you to manage and reply to them. This section contains information about
      configuring a WebHelp Responsive system and customizing the output.</p>
    <p>WebHelp Responsive output can be produced by using built-in transformation scenarios from
      within <b>Oxygen XML Editor/Author</b> or by using the <b>Oxygen XML WebHelp Plugin</b> to
      process the transformations from a <xref
        href="using-the-webhelp-plugin.dita#using-the-webhelp-plugin">script outside of <b>Oxygen
          XML Editor/Author</b></xref>.</p>
