    <p><b>Oxygen XML WebHelp Responsive</b> output is compliant with the <xref
        href="https://www.section508.gov/" format="html" scope="external">Section 508 accessibility
        standard</xref>, making the output accessible for people with visual impairment and other
      disabilities. Documentation and interface components are considered accessible when they have
      support in place that allows those with disabilities to use assistive technologies to
      understand the content.</p>
    <p>Generally speaking, the WebHelp Responsive output has two major parts: topic content and
      WebHelp Responsive-related components (publication TOC, breadcrumb, menu). While the WebHelp
      Responsive components are designed to comply with the accessibility rules, it is important to
      adhere to some rules when you write DITA topics so that the content is also accessible.</p>
