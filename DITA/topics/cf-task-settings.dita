    <p>This page includes the following options:</p>
    <p>
      <dl id="dl_fdj_z2p_zxb">
        <dlentry>
          <dt>Enforce Change Tracking</dt>
          <dd>If this option is selected, <i>Change Tracking</i> is always on when the
              <b>Reviewers</b> make changes or add comments in the files attached to the task. This
            allows you and other <b>Reviewers</b> to see exactly what has been changed and you will
            have the ability to accept or reject the changes after you have integrated them back
            into <term>Oxygen XML Editor/Author</term>. If you deselect this option, the <i>Change
              Tracking</i> mechanism is turned off for this particular task, but other tasks are not
            affected.</dd>
        </dlentry>
        <dlentry>
          <dt>Enable Concurrent Editing</dt>
          <dd>If this option is selected, multiple reviewers who have access to the task can edit
            and review the same document simultaneously. They can all see who is modifying the
            document in both the main visual editor and in the activity stream on the left side of
            the interface, in real time. For more information, see <xref
              href="cf-concurrent-editing.dita"/>.</dd>
        </dlentry>
        <dlentry>
          <dt>Delete</dt>
          <dd>Selecting this action will delete the task from the <ph keyref="product"/>
            server.</dd>
