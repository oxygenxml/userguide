    <p id="p_oqt_dgk_54b">When you click on a file attached to a task, that particular file is
      opened in the <ph keyref="product"/> visual editor. This is where reviewers can proofread,
      propose changes, and add comments in the files. The task owner can also use this visual editor
      to view or manage the proposed changes and comments, or to make their own changes. For
      example, the task owner can accept or reject changes proposed by reviewers, add new comments,
      reply to existing comments, or edit the document directly in the browser interface.</p>
    <p id="p_pqt_dgk_54b">The <ph keyref="product"/> visual editor includes a variety of panes, components, and
      features. The main editing pane and many of the components and features inherit functionality

              panel. For DITA projects, if the task owner specified a context DITA map, this panel
              shows the hierarchy of all the attached files as they appear in the specified DITA
              map. The topic title hierarchy from the DITA map is also displayed underneath each

      <title>Main Editing Pane</title>
      <p id="p_uqt_dgk_54b">This editor allows you to review and edit content similar to other
        common online editors. In most cases, the <term>tracked changes</term> feature will always
        be on so you and the task owner can see exactly what was changed and will be able to easily
        accept or reject the changes.</p>
      <p id="p_vqt_dgk_54b">The visual editor includes a variety of useful editing features:<ul id="ul_zb4_zcx_4jb">
          <li id="li_wqt_dgk_54b"><b>Smart Paste</b> - When you use copy/paste actions, the built-in <term>Smart
              Paste</term> feature preserves certain style and structure information.</li>
          <li id="li_xqt_dgk_54b"><b>Contextual Menu Actions</b> - The contextual menu offers some editing actions that
            are specific to the type of document you are working with, depending on the specific
            location within the document.</li>
          <li id="li_yqt_dgk_54b"><b>Content Completion Assistant</b> - The <term>Content Completion Assistant</term>
            helps you insert valid XML content. It offers a list of elements, attributes, attribute
            values, and other options that are valid at the current location. It tries to determine
            the most logical choice in the current editing context and displays that proposal at the
            beginning of the list. The feature is activated when you press
                <uicontrol><shortcut>Enter</shortcut></uicontrol> on your keyboard and you can
            navigate through the list of proposals by using the
              <uicontrol><shortcut>Up</shortcut></uicontrol> and
                <uicontrol><shortcut>Down</shortcut></uicontrol> arrow keys and to insert the
            selection, simply press <uicontrol><shortcut>Enter</shortcut></uicontrol> again.</li>
          <li id="li_zqt_dgk_54b"><b>Breadcrumb</b> - The main editing pane includes a <i>breadcrumb</i> stripe that
            shows the hierarchical XML structure of the current document, from the document root to
            the current element. By default, it is displayed at the bottom of the main editing area.
            You can click the double arrow button (<image href="../img/BreadcrumbTop16.png"
              id="image_cd5_1cx_4jb"/>) on the right side of the breadcrumb to move it to the top.
            The last element listed in the <term>breadcrumb</term> is the element at the current
            cursor position. Clicking an element from the <term>breadcrumb</term> selects the entire
            element in the editor area.</li>
          <li id="li_art_dgk_54b"><b>Automatic Spell Checking</b> - The visual editor automatically checks for spelling
            errors when a document is loaded and every time a modification is made in the document.
            Words that are detected as spelling errors are underlined with a jagged red line. If you
            right-click on the word, you are presented with a list of suggestions that you can
            select from to replace the word and an <uicontrol>Ignore</uicontrol> option.</li>
          <li id="li_qdp_s2n_zxb"><b>Supported Document Types</b> - The visual editor will open any
            of the supported XML document types, including <b>DITA</b>, <b>DITA maps</b>,
              <b>DocBook</b>, <b>XHTML</b>, and <b>TEI</b>. It also provides limited support for
            some other document types (for example, <b>Markdown</b> documents can opened as
            read-only in the visual editor).</li>

        edit it. If other people have the file opened, you will see their avatars on the right side
        of the <uicontrol>Files</uicontrol> box. You can hover over an avatar to see the name of the
        person. If someone else is currently editing the particular file, you will see a

        other users do not start editing the file, or once they are finished and it becomes
        unlocked, a <uicontrol>Resume Editing</uicontrol> button will be displayed that can be used
        to switch back to editing mode. Note that the lock status is automatically refreshed every
        minute, so if another user unlocks a file, you may not see the status change for a minute
        unless you refresh the page manually.</p>

        can click the <uicontrol>Finalize My Review</uicontrol> button that appears in the top
        stripe. Using this button is a quick and easy way to let the task owner know that a reviewer
        is finished with their review process. Keep in mind that all files attached to the task

        locks the task and prevents others from making changes to the task. If further review is

        editable again.</p>
      <p id="p_xsg_f1j_21c">For tasks created outside a Content Fusion project, once a <i>task
