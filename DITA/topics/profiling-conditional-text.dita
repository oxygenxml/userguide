    <p id="cond-text-intro">Conditional text is a way to mark blocks of text meant to appear in some
      renditions of the document, but not in others. It differs from one variant of the document to
      another, while unconditional text appear in all document versions.</p>
    <p id="cond-text-usage-example">For instance you can mark a section of a document to be included in the manual designated for
      the <i>expert</i> users, other for the <i>novice</i> users manual while unmarked sections are
      included in any rendition.</p>
    <p id="doc-example">You can use conditional text when you develop documentation for:<ul>
        <li>a series of similar products</li>
        <li>different releases of a product</li>
        <li>various audiences</li>
      </ul></p>
    <p id="cond-text-benefits">The benefits of using conditional text include reduced effort for updating and translating
      your content and an easy way to customize the output for various audiences.</p>
    <p><ph keyref="product"/> comes with a
      preconfigured set of profiling attribute values for some of the most popular document types.
      These attributes can be redefined to match your specific needs. Also, you can define your own
      profiling attributes for a custom document type.</p>
