  <title><ph keyref="product"/> Takes Several Minutes to Start</title>
  <body>
    <p><b>Problem:</b> Some anti-virus software can cause Java applications, such as <ph
        keyref="product"/>, to start very slowly due to scanning of compressed archives (such as the
      JAR libraries that all Java applications use).</p>
    <p><b>Solution:</b> The solution is to add the <ph keyref="product"/> folder to the list of
      exceptions in the anti-virus software settings.</p>
