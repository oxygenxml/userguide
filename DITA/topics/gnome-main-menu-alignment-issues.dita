  <title>Alignment Issues of the Main Menu on Linux Systems Based on Gnome 3.x</title>
  <body>
    <p>On some Linux systems based on Gnome 3.x (e.g. Ubuntu 11.x, 12.x) the main menu of <ph
        keyref="product"/> has alignment issues when you navigate it using your mouse.</p>
    <p>This is a known problem caused by Java SE 6 1.6.0_32 and earlier. You can resolve this
      problem using the latest Java SE 6 JRE from Oracle. To download the latest version, go to
        <xref href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html"
        format="html" scope="external"
        >http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html</xref>.</p>
    <p>To bypass the JRE bundled with <ph keyref="product"/>, go to the installation directory of
        <ph keyref="product"/> and rename or move the <filepath>jre</filepath> folder. If <ph
        keyref="product"/> does not seem to locate the system JRE, either set the JAVA_HOME
      environment variable to point to the location where you have installed the JRE, or you can
      simply copy that folder with the JRE to the installation directory and rename it to
        <filepath>jre</filepath> to take the place of the bundled JRE.</p>
