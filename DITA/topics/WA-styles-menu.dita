    <p id="p_etw_bgk_54b"><ph keyref="webappProduct"/> renders the content of the XML documents
      visually, based on CSS stylesheets associated with the document. The <uicontrol><image
          href="../img/WebappMore18.png"/>More drop-down menu</uicontrol> in the top toolbar
      includes a <uicontrol>Choose styles</uicontrol> action that opens a dialog box where you can
      select one <term>main CSS style</term> and multiple <term>additional styles</term> to easily
      change the look of the document as it appears in the editor.</p>
    <p id="p_xhv_k3y_pqb">The list of CSS styles that are available depend on the <xref
        keyref="glossentry_framework"><term>framework</term></xref> (document type). </p>

    <p id="p_tb1_dgk_54b">You can select a <term>main css style</term> that applies to the whole
      document and then select one or more <term>additional styles</term> that behave like layers
      and are merged sequentially with the <term>main style</term>. Each of the styles have a
      corresponding CSS file that defines how your documents are rendered. Also, the selections are
      persistent, meaning that <ph keyref="webappProduct"/> remembers them when subsequent documents
      are opened.</p>

      <title>Main CSS Styles</title>
      <p id="p_ub1_dgk_54b">The <term>main styles</term> are listed in the top section and each of
        their corresponding CSS files contain all the styles associated with the XML elements for
        the particular type of document. You can only select one main style at a time.</p>

      <title>Additional Styles</title>
      <p id="p_vb1_dgk_54b">The <term>alternate styles</term> are listed in the bottom section and
        their corresponding CSS files contain additional styling for certain XML elements and are
        merged with the selected <term>main styles</term>. You can select as many alternate styles
        as you wish (they are applied sequentially as layers). If you are unsure about how each of
        the styles with change the look of your documents based solely upon their name, there is no
        harm in selecting them to see the difference. You can simply deselect them to revert to the
        previous look.</p>

        stylesheets for DITA documents (including some that are specifically for <term>DITA
