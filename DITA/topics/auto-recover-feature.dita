    <p><ph keyref="product"/> includes an <term>Auto Recover</term> feature to help prevent losing
      unsaved content if you encounter an application or system crash. The feature is enabled by
      default and it automatically saves documents you are working on to a specified auto-recover
      file location. At every specified interval, all documents that have been modified since the
      last auto-save are saved to the specified location.</p>
    <p>This feature is controlled by two options in the <uicontrol>Save</uicontrol> preferences
      page. You can disable it, or configure how often content is saved by selecting the desired
      value in the drop-down list of the <xref
        href="preferences-editor-save.dita#preferences-editor-save/save-auto-recover"
          ><uicontrol>Save auto-recover information every</uicontrol> option</xref>, and you can
      specify the location of the saved documents in the <xref
        href="preferences-editor-save.dita#preferences-editor-save/auto-recover-location"
          ><uicontrol>Auto-recover file location</uicontrol> option</xref>.</p>
    <p>In the event of an application or system crash, when you restart the application, <ph
        keyref="product"/> looks for an auto-recover file for each document that was open when the
      editing session was last saved (by the application). If any auto-recover files are found, a
      dialog box is displayed with options for how to handle the auto-recovered information. If a
      previously opened file was not restored from the previous editing session, re-opening the file
      will also trigger this dialog box.</p>

    <p>The dialog box offers the following choices:<ul>
        <li><uicontrol>Open recovered content in a new tab</uicontrol> - Opens the recovered
          document in a new tab.<note type="tip">You can use the <uicontrol><image
                href="../img/DiffFiles16.png"/>Compare Files</uicontrol> tool (available in the
              <uicontrol>Tools</uicontrol> menu) to compare the recovered content with the last
            saved version of the document.</note></li>
        <li><uicontrol>Replace current file content with recovered content</uicontrol> - Replaces
          the content of the last saved version of the document with the content of the recovered
          version of the document and removes the auto-recover file from disk.</li>
        <li><uicontrol>Use current file content and discard recovered content</uicontrol> - Discards
          the recovered document and retains the last saved version of the document.</li>
      </ul></p>
