  <title>Wrong Highlights of Matched Words in a Search in User Manual</title>
  <body>
    <section>
      <p>When I do a keyword search in the User Manual that comes with the <ph
          keyref="product"/> application the search
        highlights the wrong word in the text. Sometimes the highlighted word is several words after
        the matched word. What can I do to get correct highlights?</p>

    <section>
      <p>This does not happen when <ph keyref="product"/>
        runs with a built-in Java virtual machine, that is a JVM that was installed by <ph
          keyref="product"/> in a subfolder of the
        installation folder, for example on Windows and Linux when installing <ph
          keyref="product"/> with the installation wizard
        specific for that platform. When <ph
          keyref="product"/> runs from an All Platforms
        installation it uses whatever JVM was found on the host system which may be incompatible
        with the JavaHelp indexer used for creating the built-in User Manual. Such a JVM may offset
        the highlight of the matched word with several characters, usually to the right of the
        matched word. In order to see the highlight exactly on the matched word it is recommended to
        install the application with the specific installation wizard for your platform (available
        only for Windows and Linux).</p>
