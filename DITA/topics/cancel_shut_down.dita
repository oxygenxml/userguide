  <title>Cannot Cancel a System Shutdown</title>
  <body>
    <p>If I try to shutdown my Win XP when there is at least one modified document open in <ph
        keyref="product"/>, I am prompted to
      cancel the shutdown or force quit the application. If I choose <uicontrol>Cancel</uicontrol>,
      the system shuts down anyway. Why is that?</p>
    <p>This problem was reported on Windows XP systems only. The known workaround is to start <ph
        keyref="product"/> using the <codeph
          product="editor">oxygen.bat</codeph><codeph product="author">author.bat</codeph><codeph
            product="developer">oxygenDeveloper.bat</codeph> script.</p>
