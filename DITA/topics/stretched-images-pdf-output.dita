  <title>An Image Appears Stretched Out in the PDF Output</title>
  <body>
    <p>Sometimes, when publishing XML content (DITA, Docbook, etc), images are scaled up in the PDF
      outputs but are displayed perfectly in the HTML (or WebHelp) output. </p>
    <p>PDF output from XML content is obtained by first obtaining a intermediary XML format called
      XSL-FO and then applying an XSL-FO processor to it to obtain the PDF. This stretching problem
      is caused by the fact that all XSL-FO processors take into account the DPI (dots-per-inch)
      resolution when computing the size of the rendered image.</p>
    <p>The PDF processor which comes out of the box with the application is the open-source Apache
      FOP processor. Here is what Apache FOP does when deciding the image size:<ol
        id="ol_mhj_mlk_wh">
        <li>If the XSL-FO output contains width, height or a scale specified for the image
            <codeph>external-graphic</codeph> tag, then these dimensions are used. This means that
          if in the XML (DITA, Docbook, etc) you set explicit dimensions to the image they will be
          used as such in the PDF output.</li>
        <li>If there are no sizes (width, height or scale) specified on the image XML element, the
          processor looks at the image resolution information available in the image content. If the
          image has such a resolution saved in it, the resolution will be used and combined with the
          image width and height in order to obtain the rendered image dimensions.</li>
        <li>If the image does not contain resolution information inside, Apache FOP will look at the
          FOP configuration file for a default resolution. The FOP configuration file for XSLT
          transformations which output PDF is located in the
            <filepath>OXYGEN_INSTALL_DIR\lib\fop.xconf</filepath>. DITA publishing uses the DITA
          Open Toolkit which has the Apache FOP configuration file located in
            <filepath>OXYGEN_INSTALL_DIR/frameworks/dita/DITA-OT/plugins/org.dita.pdf2/fop/conf/fop.xconf</filepath>.
          The configuration file contains two XML elements called <codeph>source-resolution</codeph>
          and <codeph>target-resolution</codeph>. The values set to those elements can be increased,
          usually a DPI value of 110 or 120 should render the image in PDF just like in the HTML
          output.</li>
      </ol></p>
    <p>The commercial <b>RenderX XEP</b> XSL-FO processor behaves similarly but as a fallback it
      uses 120 as the DPI value instead of using a configuration file.</p>
    <note type="tip"><p>As a conclusion, it is best to save your images without any DPI resolution
        information in them. For example the open-source GIMP image editor allows you when saving a
        PNG image whether to save the resolution to it or not:</p><image
        href="../img/gimpSaveResolution.png" id="image_b4x_zrk_wh"/></note>
    <p>Having images without any resolution information saved in them allows you to control the
      image resolution from the configuration file for all referenced images.</p>
