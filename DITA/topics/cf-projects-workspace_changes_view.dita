      been changed in the workspace.</p>
    <p id="p_ncf_trz_vbc">You can click on a file to see a comparison (diff) of the changes. The
      version on the left shows the current workspace version while the version on the right shows
      the current project version.</p>
    <p id="p_pww_5rz_vbc">A contextual menu can be invoked by clicking the 3 vertical dots
      (ellipsis) next to a particular file when hovering over it and the following actions are
        available:<ul id="ul_cvw_fsz_vbc">
        <li id="li_dvw_fsz_vbc"><uicontrol>Open file</uicontrol> - Opens the latest editable

      <title>Create New Review Task Based on Your Workspace Changes</title>
      <p id="p_dwv_t3v_vcc">After making changes in your personal workspace, you can create a new
        review task that contains your changes. You can then share the task with others so that they
        review your changes before you integrate them back into the project.</p>
      <p id="p_hs1_2jv_vcc">To create a review task based on your changes, click the <uicontrol>New
          Review Task</uicontrol> button at the bottom of the <uicontrol>Changes</uicontrol> view.
        In the resulting page, you can give the review task a title, set a <uicontrol>Due
          date</uicontrol>, and select a <uicontrol>Context publication</uicontrol> from the list of
        defined publications for the project. The changed files that are automatically attached to
        the review task are listed in the <uicontrol>Files to review</uicontrol> box. Click
          <uicontrol>Create</uicontrol> when you are finished configuring the new review task. You
        can then <xref href="sharing_tasks_with_reviewers.dita#sharing_tasks_with_reviewers">share
          the task with <b>Reviewers</b></xref>.</p>
