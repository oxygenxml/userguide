  <glossterm>Named User</glossterm>
  <glossdef><term>Named User</term> is defined as an individual full or part-time employee who is
    authorized by <term>You</term> (the individual or entity who owns the rights to <ph
      keyref="product"/>) to use the software regardless of whether or not the individual is actively using
    the software at any given time. To avoid any doubt, Named User licenses cannot be shared amongst
    multiple individuals and separate Named User licenses must be purchased for each individual
      user.<p>A Named User license may not be reassigned to another employee except in the following circumstances:<ul>
        <li>(a) Upon termination of the Named User’s employment with your company.</li>
        <li>(b) Permanent reassignment of a Named User to a position that does not involve the use
          of the Software.</li>
      </ul></p>For example, suppose Jane has been assigned an Oxygen XML license and she leaves your
    company. When she leaves, you can simply reassign her license to John, her replacement. In the
    event that you do reassign the Named User license in accordance with the restrictions above, you
    do not need to notify Syncro of such a reassignment.<note>This definition is taken from the <ph
