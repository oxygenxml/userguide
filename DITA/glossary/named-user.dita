  <glossterm>Named User</glossterm>
  <glossdef><b><term>Named User</term></b> is defined as an individual full or part-time employee
    who is authorized by <term>You</term> (the individual or entity who owns the rights for <ph
      keyref="product"/>) to use the software regardless of whether or not the individual is
    actively using the software at any given time. To avoid any doubt, <term>Named User</term>
    licenses cannot be shared among multiple individuals and separate <term>Named User</term>
    licenses must be purchased for each individual user.<p>A <term>Named User</term> license may not
      be reassigned to another employee except in the following circumstances:<ul>
        <li>(a) Upon termination of the <term>Named User’s</term> employment with your company.</li>
        <li>(b) Permanent reassignment of a <term>Named User</term> to a position that does not
          involve the use of the Software.</li>
      </ul></p>For example, suppose Jane has been assigned an <term>Oxygen</term> license and she
    leaves your company. When she leaves, you can simply reassign her license to John, her
    replacement. In the event that you do reassign the <term>Named User</term> license in accordance
    with the restrictions above, you do not need to notify Syncro of such a reassignment.<note
