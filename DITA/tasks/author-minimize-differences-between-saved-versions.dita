    <context>The number of differences between versions of the same file saved by different content
      authors on different computers can be minimized by imposing the same set of formatting options
      when saving the file, for all the content authors. An example for a procedure that minimizes
      the differences is the following.</context>
    <steps id="procedure-minimize-differences-between-versions-saved-in-Author">
      <step>
        <cmd>Create an <ph keyref="product"/> project file
          that will be shared by all content authors.</cmd>
      </step>
      <step>
        <cmd>Set your own preferences in the following panels of the
            <uicontrol>Preferences</uicontrol> dialog: <uicontrol>Editor</uicontrol> /
            <uicontrol>Format</uicontrol> and <uicontrol>Editor</uicontrol> /
            <uicontrol>Format</uicontrol> / <uicontrol>XML</uicontrol>.</cmd>
      </step>
      <step>
        <cmd>Save the preferences of these two panels in the <ph keyref="product"/> project by
          selecting the button <uicontrol>Project Options</uicontrol> in these two panels.</cmd>
      </step>
      <step>
        <cmd>Save the project and commit the project file to your versioning system so all the
          content authors can use it.</cmd>
      </step>
      <step>
        <cmd>Make sure the project is opened in the <uicontrol>Project</uicontrol> view.</cmd>
      </step>
      <step>
        <cmd>Open and save your XML files in the <uicontrol>Author</uicontrol> mode.</cmd>
      </step>
      <step>
        <cmd>Commit the saved XML files to your versioning system.</cmd>
      </step>
    </steps>
    <result>When other content authors will change the files only the changed lines will be
      displayed in your diff tool instead of one big change that does not allow to see the changes
      between two versions of the file.</result>
