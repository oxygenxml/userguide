 <title>What Is a Patch</title>
  <conbody>
    <p>Let's suppose you are working to a set of XML files, that you distribute to other people.
      From time to time you are tagging the project and distribute the releases. If you continue
      working for a period correcting problems, you may find yourself in the situations to notify
      your users that you have corrected a problem. In this case you may prefer to distribute them a
      patch, a collection of differences that applied over the last distribution would correct the
      problem. The SVN client creates the patch in <xref href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff#Unified_format" scope="external" format="html">the
        Unified Diff format</xref>. </p>
    <p>Creating a patch in <ph
        conref="../topics/oxygenEntitiesDictionary.dita#OxygenEntities/apacheSubversion"/> implies
      the access to two states (revisions) of a project:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>the current working copy and a revision from the repository - if you have not committed
        yet your current working copy and prefer not to do it, you create a patch between the
        current working copy and a revision from the repository;</li>
      <li>two repository revisions - if both states are two revisions already committed to the
        repository.</li>
    </ul>
