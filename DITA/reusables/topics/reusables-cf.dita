      <p>The <b>Content Fusion Enterprise Virtual Machine</b> should have the following ports accessible:<ul>
          <li><b>80, 443</b> - For HTTP/HTTPS access to the main application.</li>
          <li><b>9080</b> - For access to the administration page (you may want to restrict access
            to only have this page available to certain computers).</li>
          <li><b>22</b> - For SSH access.</li>
        </ul></p>

      <p>To configure <ph keyref="product"/> on the initial start of the VM, use the following
        procedure:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Access the administration web interface of <ph keyref="product"/> at:
            <codeph>https://&lt;server-address>:9080</codeph>.<note>By default, <ph keyref="product"
            /> uses a self-signed certificate, so the browser will display a security warning.
            Continue (for example, if you are using Edge or Internet Explorer, click <b>Details</b>
            and then <b>Go on to the webpage</b>).</note></li>
        <li>Login using the following credentials:<ul>
            <li><b>user</b> = <i>fusion</i></li>
            <li><b>password</b> = <i>oxygenxml</i></li>
          </ul></li>
        <li>Change the password.</li>
        <li>In the <uicontrol>General</uicontrol> tab, configure the <uicontrol>Domain
            Name</uicontrol> of the server. To properly configure the server, you should associate a
          domain name for this server in your <term>DNS</term>.<p>You can also use the server IP
            address instead of the domain name. In this case, the server will run with several limitations:<ul>
              <li>The e-mail messages generated by the server are more likely to be considered as
                SPAM.</li>
              <li>HTTPS support cannot be enabled.</li>
            </ul><note>By default, the <uicontrol>Domain Name</uicontrol> is populated with one of
              the IP addresses associated with the server. It is recommended that you check this IP
              address to make sure it can be accessed by your end users.</note></p></li>
        <li>In the <uicontrol>License</uicontrol> tab:<ul>
            <li>If you already have a license key, choose the <uicontrol>Already have a license
                key</uicontrol> option, paste your license key in the text field and press
                <uicontrol>Activate</uicontrol>.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, choose the <uicontrol>Request a trial license key</uicontrol> option and
              complete the request form.</li>
          </ul></li>
      </ol>

      <title>Configuring Oxygen XML Editor/Author to Connect to Your Enterprise Server</title>
      <p>All <b>Content Authors</b> in your organization that will be uploading tasks will need to
        configure <term>Oxygen XML Editor/Author</term> to connect to your Enterprise server. You
        need to provide them with your Enterprise server URL and then each of them will need to
        follow the procedure found in: <xref
          href="../../topics/connect-to-enterprise-server.dita#connect-to-enterprise-server"/>.
        Alternatively, if you want to impose the server URL for all <b>Content Authors</b> so that
        they do not need to do any manual configuration, you can <xref
          href="../../topics/cf-configure-server-address-property-file.dita">create a properties
          file to impose the Enterprise server address</xref>.</p>
