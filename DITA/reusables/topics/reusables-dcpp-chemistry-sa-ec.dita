    <note id="note1">The XPath expression from the page rules is evaluated in the context of the
      document root element, so you will need to use absolute expressions starting with
        <codeph>/</codeph> or <codeph>//</codeph>. This is different from the case when the
        <codeph>oxy_xpath</codeph> is used in CSS rules that match an element. In this case, the
      XPath expressions are evaluated in the context of the matched element and you can use relative
      paths.</note>
    <note type="tip" id="note2">XPath 2.0 is supported (not schema aware). </note>
